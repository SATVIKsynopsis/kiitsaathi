## Setup Instructions

To get a local copy of KiitSaathi up and running on your machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   Node.js (v18 or higher)
    *   npm (v9 or higher) or Yarn (v1.22 or higher) or Bun (v1.0 or higher)
    *   Git

2.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KrishnaMohanty08/kiitsaathi1.git
    cd kiitsaathi1
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies**:
    Choose your preferred package manager:
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm install

    # Using Yarn
    yarn install

    # Using Bun
    bun install
    ```

4.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. This file will store your Supabase credentials.
    ```plaintext
    VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="your_supabase_project_id"
    VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your_supabase_publishable_key"
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="your_supabase_url"
    ```
    *   You can find these values in your Supabase project settings under "API".
    *   The `VITE_` prefix is necessary for Vite to expose these variables to the client-side code.

5.  **Run the development server**:
    Start the application in development mode:
    ```bash
    # Using npm
    npm run dev

    # Using Yarn
    yarn dev

    # Using Bun
    bun dev
    ```

6.  **Open your browser**:
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or another port if 5173 is in use). Open this URL in your web browser to see KiitSaathi in action.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are crucial for the application's connection to Supabase:

*   `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`: Your unique Supabase project identifier.
*   `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: The public API key for your Supabase project. This key is safe to expose in your client-side code.
*   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: The base URL for your Supabase project's API.

**Important**: Do not commit your `.env` file to version control. It is already included in `.gitignore` to prevent accidental exposure of sensitive keys.
