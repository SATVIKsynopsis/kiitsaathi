2
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:27,470
Hey, so five minutes.

3
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:17,510
BMW guys are bitching about break trouble.

4
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:43,830
Turn right back one minute.

5
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:51,790
Honey. We dropped down to seventh.

6
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,110
You can just overnight hopeful.
Sunrise catches just a break.

7
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:13,030
Holding up but go easy.

8
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,970
The crowds may have gone
but the racing continues.

9
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:40,690
Sunny Hayes ran the for
Geico racing Midnight shift

10
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,810
wheel likes to light up the night, but
with the BMW at the head of his pack,

11
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,760
he's got a massive job ahead of him.

12
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,130
Three. Moving up to the third place.

13
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,650
Don't want to me the just will

14
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:38,930
table let do this.

15
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,930
Any indication it appears
as though sunny hay.

16
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:49,110
See that that shot right boys, you get
back in that car, you need to do thing.

17
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:04,550
Up. Aren.

18
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,830
Hey, who's that lead? I'll kill you.

19
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:21,523
Hey.

20
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,530
I believe you forgot
something back's full chip.

21
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,290
Seriously your first win in Daytona.
Don't you even want to touch it? Come on.

22
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:05,450
Bad.

23
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:05,960
Luck. Bad luck.

24
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:06,793
Just touch it.

25
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,490
Yeah, will take that bonus check though.

26
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:17,690
So, so just hear me out. Look,

27
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,530
I want to bring you on board, your
CHR family now right here. Next year.

28
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,690
Let's run it back. We did it man.
Deal's the deal. I know what a deal is.

29
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:31,890
So that's it. One and done. I
appreciate the seat chip. I really do.

30
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,250
What kind of way is that?

31
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,170
The race you just spent your whole
life starting over man. Take care.

32
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,370
I'll see you down the road.

33
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,810
Hey, which one to watch? Got one.

34
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,950
Sorry. Can I use your phone for a
second please? It's not working.

35
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,563
No,

36
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:35,510
you know you remind me of this
friend I used to have. Which friend?

37
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,350
Friend who dressed better?

38
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,150
This is a goche suit. So's this,
huh? What do your friend do?

39
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,790
Drove cars. Was he
fast? A slow Did a wing?

40
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:49,573
Yeah he did.

41
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,950
Your son of a bitch. Oh, are you thinking?

42
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,470
Yeah. New day, new challenge. Exactly.

43
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:01,590
When I said to my son when I bought Aex GP

44
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,310
How deep in the hole
are you? I'll tell you,

45
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,470
but you have to promise
not to laugh. Shoot

46
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,350
350 million.

47
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:25,030
Don't laugh. Impressive. Well,

48
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:29,230
Ben, fun. Oh yeah, absolutely.
What's the problem then?

49
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,750
The problem is two seasons
and a half, zero points.

50
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:37,510
My best driver left for another
team except the car was a shit box.

51
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:38,750
The.

52
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,390
Team is your last place. My number two,
the rookie and the seasons have over,

53
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,870
lemme races left nine and we don't
turn it around. I lose the team.

54
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:52,030
But you own the team. No race wins.

55
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,210
In the first three seasons
the board can force a sales.

56
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,680
And it sounds like you need a new board.

57
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,713
Your driver.

58
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,790
You got to have two,
you got to have three.

59
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:14,030
You got a tyre assembly
line of kids raised on the.

60
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,830
Simulator. No, I don't have time for
some kids to learn how to come and tell.

61
00:09:16,950 --> 00:09:17,700
I don't.

62
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,230
Well you don't just walk off
the street and pilot a rocket.

63
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,950
Yes you can if you've done it
before. That's the whole point.

64
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,950
Was 57 years old when he won the Monaco
Grand Prix? Who was who? Philipp.

65
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,590
56 years old. Google these names didn't
you? Some people look at Sonny Hayes.

66
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,300
They see a guy who lives in the van, a
gambling junkie who missed his shot. Wow.

67
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,180
Ruben, you are really s what? I
see a guy who makes teams better.

68
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,070
I see experience. I see knowhow. You
your my rookie is a phenomenal talent.

69
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:49,990
Phenomenal. But he's young. You
know what he likes maturity.

70
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,150
You plus him.

71
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,110
Boom. I got a team. Alright,
let's say I'm the next Louis Jean.

72
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,910
Him. The problem is it's not
just the driver, it's a car.

73
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:06,910
I followed your season. Ruben Shitbox
is being kind. I knew you were.

74
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,230
Watching. What if I told you we'd
get an upgrade package this weekend?

75
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:13,180
Six months in development.
Really? No. No. Wait,

76
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:17,420
I just need one of my cars across
the finish line. First one.

77
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,950
I love you. I'm not going back.

78
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,300
Okay. Okay.

79
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,230
What would he want you to do?

80
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,800
Join a boy band. Seriously.

81
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:35,993
Come on.

82
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,730
Seriously. I'd ask him
what he smiling about.

83
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,570
Come on. He's smiling at the possibility.

84
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:46,450
We both.

85
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,290
Know how that ended.

86
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,800
Yeah. Okay.

87
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,170
This is the first class
ticket to first class.

88
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,090
I'm offering you an open
seat in Formula one.

89
00:11:02,270 --> 00:11:06,050
The only place you could
say for one day if you win,

90
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,170
you are the absolute best in the world.

91
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,890
Hey Ruben. Ever seen a miracle?

92
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:25,303
Not yet.

93
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:28,720
Me neither. Good, see you Migo.

94
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,600
Alright sweetie. Here you go.
Thank you. You're welcome.

95
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:37,840
Hey, let me ask you something close.

96
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,680
Friend of yours made you an offer
that was 100% positively too good

97
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,080
to be true. What do you do?

98
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,000
Well, how much are we talking?

99
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,213
Not about the money.

100
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,280
So what is it about.

101
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,720
One best one yet? Cough feels good.

102
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:11,300
Bring in Go distract one.
Boxy slab. Boxy slab.

103
00:14:24,950 --> 00:14:26,540
Let's go find those Ments.

104
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,250
Sorry Julie,

105
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:09,850
try not to kill our driver.

106
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,330
What's the verdict? I don't know
what's happening. I mean it feels good.

107
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,010
I start to push then on the stairs and
the slow corners and no stairs to fast.

108
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,090
What on.

109
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:26,923
Entries? Exits.

110
00:15:27,190 --> 00:15:28,610
Either. Both.

111
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:29,933
Great. Yeah.

112
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:32,930
Oh, there's 10,000 sensor on this thing
and you can't tell me what's going on.

113
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:37,570
But I'm not out there am I? So I am
going to need your help on this. Please.

114
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,090
Cook win.

115
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:48,903
He coming.

116
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:56,610
$150 Million Jungle. Jim.

117
00:15:57,670 --> 00:16:01,650
So cute. We just let her
drive. Can't be any worse.

118
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:05,823
Joshua.

119
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,530
Hi Elizabeth here.

120
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:09,730
Oh yeah.

121
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:11,490
Doesn't matter. The press conference,

122
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,850
we want to steer around tech issues and
focus on the S strong bond with your new

123
00:16:16,010 --> 00:16:16,850
teammate Luca Cortez.

124
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:22,770
Luca who I've known a week who only
was stir on the left at Red Board,

125
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:27,450
told the press he thought Joshua
Pierce was overrated. That Luca Cortez.

126
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,543
Yes.

127
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:35,410
Can't wait. All right, great.
Thank you. That's a yes. Yeah. Yes.

128
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:40,370
Sir. You right Ruben in big trouble.

129
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:44,970
He might have this on the team
knew. What does that mean for me?

130
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:48,930
Buyers is likely to
clean the house. Listen,

131
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:53,930
you need to show these people who
the number one driver really is, man.

132
00:16:55,190 --> 00:17:00,090
How Well you're going
to lose your job. Yeah,

133
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:01,970
let that sink in.

134
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,863
We should be shooting.

135
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,273
Okay,

136
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:18,240
let's take the first half of the
season and raise it from our minds.

137
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:24,290
Someone says, Casper, what happened this
year? I swear the lives of my children,

138
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:26,480
I do not freaking know.

139
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:30,690
There's only this car and there is only

140
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:33,683
our future.

141
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:47,950
Who is that asshole? Wait a minute,

142
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,610
your man thought I was maintenance
sent me to the back gate.

143
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,890
Brother, you've never let me down.

144
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,330
Well there's still time.

145
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:02,770
AP GP. So Hayes, you race with
me back in the day against you.

146
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:05,890
You meet King McKenna,
our technical director,

00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:11,690
Dutch do or Tiff mechanic
Linsky team principle.

148
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,480
You may know him by reputation.

149
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:16,050
Five time constructors
champion with Ferrari

150
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,830
as a real Jackman.

151
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,030
So is my pop. Can't win without him and.

152
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:26,830
I'm tell it the rookie Joshua,
why does he got a helmet? Safety?

153
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:32,150
Joshua, your city is safe. Okay,
son is here for the audition.

154
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,050
When was.

155
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,690
The last time you won a
race? Sunday. Daytona. Oh.

156
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:38,663
I'm sorry.

157
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,720
I meant Formula one. Oh,
I'm sorry. Then same as you.

158
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,610
Nevertheless say this. Has
anyone seen Luca Cortez.

159
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,650
When I interviewed with
you many little drivers?

160
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,090
Yeah, I all turned you down.

161
00:18:54,870 --> 00:18:55,703
How many?

162
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,460
Seven.

163
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,050
That's a lot. I'm number seven.

164
00:18:58,910 --> 00:18:59,640
You're eight.

165
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,530
This is a disaster.

166
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,050
Certainly you're more like a Technically
there is one who I've not heard from me

167
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:05,330
yet, but so I am a nine.

168
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:07,010
You know how numbers work right?

169
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:10,090
In business, my most
inspired ideas come late.

170
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,570
Yeah.

171
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:10,850
Best.

172
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,290
Things in life.

173
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,930
Usually write nights,
right? With respect. Ruben,

174
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:17,850
I cannot condone respect Our only test
they giving your long lost teammate and

175
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:18,720
audition.

176
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:21,850
Because by misunderstanding we're
not auditioning him. He's ing us.

177
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,650
That's your new driver. Good luck,

178
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,140
new wing, new side pods.
Any changes to the floor?

179
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,900
Not in the eight Other drivers
wouldn't have figured out.

180
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,380
That's why they call me Lucky number nine.

181
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,900
Listen, it's been a while since you've
driven that mate. You had a balance on.

182
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,940
These cars are tricky, so be
careful. Turn one and nine.

183
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,300
I don't want to see you get hurt.

184
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:49,830
How about we set a reasonable target?
Give me the same setup as him.

185
00:19:49,850 --> 00:19:52,350
If I can't post a lap time
within a second of jps,

186
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,910
then I will promptly see myself out.

187
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:56,830
You're free to take a shot
at lucky number 10, 10.

188
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,363
10.

189
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:02,870
10. Who's jp?

190
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,283
Be careful on.

191
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,290
Okay, let's see what you got.

192
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:04,290
If he raised, he raised.

193
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,770
I used to be. Alright, put up Joshua.

194
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,330
Tony. Criticism is taxi. Make
it a hundred. You're on. Oh

195
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:00,210
sorry. This is Hugh Nickel or
race Ine. Good morning you.

196
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:03,050
How are my temps looking? Yep.
Almost one head to the left.

197
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:04,240
You should be good to push.

198
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:26,610
Right? You? Yes sir.

199
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:29,690
You should have taken that bet. Copy.

200
00:22:29,690 --> 00:22:30,523
That.

201
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,033
Come on.

202
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,610
Wait, wait.

203
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,870
You okay? Yeah. All good?

204
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,510
Yeah, she's got a something.

205
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:48,070
Yeah, you mean had something.

206
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:52,740
But definitely snapping the high
speed corners. Unpredictable.

207
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:56,550
Delos had trouble with
the rears turns 14, 16 on.

208
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,070
The finals.

209
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:57,903
Turn maybe.

210
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,110
No, that's on me. Well what she left time.

211
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,630
He passed his entirely self-imposed
test by five hundreds of second.

212
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:16,150
Well it's start.

213
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:26,130
Bro.

214
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:31,070
We got nine races to catch the eye
of another team and as your manager I

215
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:33,630
have to advise you that we need to
start hitting these social and sponsor

216
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,430
events. You need more engagement
Josh Moore. Alright cool.

217
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:41,510
I'm just saying isn't
it? I'm starving. Nah,

218
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,430
go see someone though. Yeah. Hey,
take a picture off. Post that shit.

219
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:51,310
Send it to me. I'll post that shit. It's
my mom. Don't you dare post that shit.

220
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:53,870
I knew you was going to say.

221
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:07,293
Okay baby.

222
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,510
Yeah, just tired.

223
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:11,980
Bad tyres or the engine.

224
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,630
Come on mom. You don't
know about the cars.

225
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:20,110
Fiercely. Alright, I may not know much
about cars but I know a lot about you.

226
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,283
Go.

227
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:28,550
I might lose my seat. The team
not going to race anyways.

228
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:30,683
You are other teams.

229
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,790
Yeah, there's 20 seats
but they're all filled.

230
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:37,070
Plus there's this new guy and he's old.

231
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:38,403
How old?

232
00:26:38,610 --> 00:26:40,790
Really old. Like 80.

233
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:47,850
He is such an asshole
Mom. He's quit though.

234
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:51,050
Don't mind that focus on you.

235
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,770
You can spend your whole life worrying
about other people but your time is right

236
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:59,080
now. You still love it.

237
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:02,150
Of course. I still love it.

238
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,350
And remember what your father used to say?

239
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:10,180
Put your head down and drive. Yes ma'am.

240
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,313
You kidding me?

241
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,540
Thought your job was to build
the fastest car on the planet.

242
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:05,490
My job is wind, so helps to feel it.

243
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:14,340
Mysterious moves at Apex GP who have
finally announced the driver who will take

244
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,980
their second seat. And in a bizarre twist,

245
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:21,420
it's American sunny Hayes who hasn't
raced in Formula one For over three

246
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,820
decades, son of an IndyCar mechanic,

247
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,420
Hayes was considered something
of a reckless young phenomenon.

248
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,140
The greatest who never was his former
career being brought to an abrupt halt

249
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,580
by horrific accident at
the Spanish Grand Prix.

250
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:40,660
He reappeared a decade later in racing
championships as diverse as Lamont,

251
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,340
nascar the Dakar rally and even a
stint as a New York taxi driver.

252
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:51,780
But now he's back racing for a team
which has in its entire F1 history never

253
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,660
even finished in the top 10.

254
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:58,700
None of this will dampen speculation that
majority shareholders of Anez capital

255
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,380
are looking to sell the
team and if they do,

256
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,020
that will likely also bring an end to
the career of F1 rookie Joshua Pierce.

257
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,740
Can.

258
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,060
We go now?

259
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:09,460
Desperate times they say
call for desperate measures,

260
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:14,140
but I honestly cannot recall a driver
signing quite as desperate as this

261
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,020
boy. Look at.

262
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,180
My son. That's the one.

263
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,020
That's the other driver.

264
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,300
Yeah, that's him and his stupid face.

265
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,940
But wait, you say he was
old. He not that old.

266
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:34,420
Hey Josh, you want the next shot
anywhere? Nine races means nine times.

267
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:38,340
You have to beat Chop Norris for now.

268
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:43,330
Start by winning over the press.
Yeah. You ready? Cool. Let's go.

269
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,090
That's a handsome man right there. Yeah.

270
00:29:50,110 --> 00:29:55,050
Joshua. Hey, it's been an under an
opening, messy start to your season,

271
00:29:55,430 --> 00:29:56,263
no wins,

272
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,130
car problems throughout and now
you have another new teammate.

273
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:02,770
How exactly are you finding them?

274
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:08,450
Messy start doesn't mean you can't finish
knee right Apex have a fire crew of

275
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:12,330
engineers. I'm confident we'll come
back. Five. In terms of new teammates,

276
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:16,410
I think it's really wonderful that Apex
are given second chances to the elderly.

277
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:21,450
Yes. Next question. Thank you. Yes, Don?

278
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:26,170
Mr. Hayes. Hi Don. Cav, welcome
back to the uk. It's been a while.

279
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:28,570
I mean last time you race at Silverston,

280
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:31,010
bill Clinton was your president
and we were all dancing.

281
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:34,450
The Macarena must be surreal to be back.

282
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:37,913
Yeah.

283
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:44,650
And during that decay you gave up
racing and gambled professionally

284
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:49,730
before declaring yourself
personally bankrupt. Yep.

285
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:54,010
You had a marriage and no and
two more ended in divorce. Yeah.

286
00:30:57,290 --> 00:31:00,850
Anything you wish you'd
done differently? Yeah.

287
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,330
No more questions. Thank you.

288
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,690
For a bit per pie. Aviator
live casino or top slots.

289
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,730
Asan deposit this.

290
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:40,970
And before you.

291
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,850
Okay, here he comes. Apologise.

292
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,810
I apologise. I can't do that.

293
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:02,170
How you mean? Why not? Because it's a
sign of weakness. It's a sign of strength.

294
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,290
Sign of weakness.

295
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:05,970
Yeah. Dear, just do it Mom.

296
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:06,650
I.

297
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:08,490
Can't. You can you will.

298
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:21,903
Hey man.

299
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:26,130
A day at a press conference.
Stuff I said wasn't cool

300
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,623
so.

301
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:35,490
Basically what I'm trying to
say, I'm sorry. It's all right.

302
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:37,730
You're just worried I'm quicker
than you. Hi, I'm sunny.

303
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:40,370
Bernadette Pierce, nice to meet you.

304
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,410
Pleasure. It's all good.
I'll see you out there.

305
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,290
How you feeling? So good. Good.

306
00:34:00,870 --> 00:34:02,850
You good, good, good.

307
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,503
No pressure.

308
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:12,460
Great.

309
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,293
Great.

310
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:14,853
Great.

311
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:20,360
Welcome. Along to Silverstone, the
circuit where on the 13th of May, 1950,

312
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,970
the formula one world championship began.

313
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:27,800
Today we kick off the final nine races
of this great championship season

314
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:28,930
here in the.

315
00:34:28,930 --> 00:34:31,800
77Th British draw three as always,

316
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,410
11 tiers will take the grid fielding
two drivers each with race order

317
00:34:37,050 --> 00:34:38,840
determined by the qualifying time set.

318
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:43,840
Yesterday will start
on followed by the and

319
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,693
two Ferrari.

320
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:20,840
Ruben.

321
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:23,690
Don't even talk to the moment,
just smile and shake hands.

322
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,840
He's an important member of the
board. Sonny, this is Peter,

323
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:32,050
one of my investors. Hi. He knows
absolutely nothing about racing but.

324
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,170
At least my eyes and ears on the
board and your Rubin's Hail Mary.

325
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,320
That is American football term,
right? The Hail Mary. The long shot.

326
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:42,770
I believe it's a religious
term. It is true. That is true.

327
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:44,970
I'm praying to them all. Yeah,

328
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:46,890
I'm the one guy on the board who
actually wants to keep the team.

329
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:50,570
The rest accordingly. Ants inferno.
But seriously man, I'm on the hook.

330
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,450
I've binged all of drive to survive.

331
00:35:53,130 --> 00:35:56,050
I honestly don't think I've ever known
so much about ties is incredible.

332
00:35:56,230 --> 00:35:57,090
I'm going to get back to my.

333
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:02,803
Why are.

334
00:37:23,420 --> 00:37:27,790
Here first on the track.

335
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,990
Chance for the drivers to
warm up their tyres and.

336
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:35,010
Brakes. No,

337
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:39,730
there's a problem for Apex.
That's in P 22. It cars,

338
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,840
hang on, I got power
trouble. It's start mode,

339
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:48,410
sunny start mode on. Yes. So
lesson for everyone at home.

340
00:37:48,910 --> 00:37:50,410
New car did read the manual.

341
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,050
It's been a while since he
was out on the track of this.

342
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:55,290
Race. He's not even going
to get into the race.

343
00:37:58,010 --> 00:37:58,843
I got it.

344
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:07,450
If he falls too far behind
on the formation drink,

345
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,130
he'll be at risk of having
to start in the pit.

346
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:16,320
We're sunny. He's holding us up. Yeah,
just checking your truck. Just checking.

347
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,930
What's wrong with his car but
nothing with the plate Track ahead.

348
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,490
Hay has been able to push much harder
on this formation now he'll turn off at

349
00:38:25,490 --> 00:38:28,170
the back of the grid
with warm ready to go.

350
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:31,170
Cheeky it's on.

351
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,010
What is this guy doing.

352
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,443
In your.

353
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,970
He's seven places since

354
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,250
has really struggled with this car.

355
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,410
They brought an upgrade
package this weekend.

356
00:39:58,390 --> 00:40:00,570
Around this dirty air.
Can't position to attack.

357
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,010
He's complaining about his car over.
That's not what the team wants to hear.

358
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,970
Copy gap is 0.9 to dur within GRS range
should be able to take him on the next.

359
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:11,803
Train.

360
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:21,490
System to get, won't be
able to hold it up guys,

361
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:24,210
I got no grip. This is
trouble now for Apex G.

362
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,840
The Rebels tyres are now
warm and hasn't got his tyre

363
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:32,730
anymore. We've seen the attack
now it's all about defence.

364
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:37,970
All the attack pace is in
trouble. This could be.

365
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:38,803
The places

366
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:44,010
and it's damn this loose.
Tell me if you see.

367
00:40:44,010 --> 00:40:47,090
A fixed, tell him to pull it back
the entry to get a better exit.

368
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:49,650
He thinks it's a, it's not.

369
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:56,530
20. Joshua appears struggling
out there at the moment.

370
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,930
Go get me off the go backwards.

371
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:04,930
Copy that 20 box box states
couldn't be hired for rookie Joshua,

372
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:08,490
this is not where you
want to be in last place.

373
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:25,040
Hit something. What was that?
Sit with the second pit stop.

374
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:29,520
Apex GP won't be happy with that taken

375
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:36,610
box copy to the bead box and
here comes sunny Hayes for a

376
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:37,443
fresh set of tyres.

377
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,770
You'll be hoping these will help
hold up to his current position.

378
00:41:41,410 --> 00:41:45,090
P 15 Jack, Jack, not properly.

379
00:41:45,590 --> 00:41:49,170
This is causing P in the A

380
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:56,010
go wrong is going wrong for this team.

381
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:16,150
So.

382
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:19,590
The pace man, tell him to let me
boss. Yeah. Position. Standby eight.

383
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:21,950
Josh is faster. Sunny's un coone tyres.

384
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,390
Yeah. Okay, so now fighting let through.

385
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,003
No fighting.

386
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,390
Who's fighting? I'm racing.

387
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:42,030
Trying.

388
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:45,670
To make you concrete up against
the old pit ball there Joshua.

389
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,430
You're going to have to fight for
position. You are a great honey. Hey fuck,

390
00:42:49,780 --> 00:42:54,150
they're giving absolutely no
quarter, no benefit to their at.

391
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:58,710
They're win a but this is the battle.

392
00:43:07,050 --> 00:43:07,883
Do.

393
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:40,400
No, this is mad.

394
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:44,040
The cardinal sin motoring double PN.

395
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:49,200
Just when it couldn't get any worse with
a black and gold. That's a tough one.

396
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:07,403
We can't corner.

397
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,070
We're bouncing around a place like we're
on the bloody tube and now we think

398
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,990
it's cool to leave will guns in the
pit box. Who even was that? That.

399
00:44:14,990 --> 00:44:16,390
Was me of course.

400
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:24,160
Old man. You losing your hearing?

401
00:44:25,270 --> 00:44:25,560
What.

402
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,393
Was that?

403
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:30,040
You want to do this here? Yeah. I'd love
to do this here in front of the team.

404
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:34,170
Right? The one that you apparently pulled.
Okay. You made a mistake. It happens.

405
00:44:35,010 --> 00:44:37,490
I made a mistake. I love this
guy. Worry about it. Jody,

406
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:39,210
are you even listening to me? Not.

407
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,130
Really. No. Stop.

408
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:44,650
Josh is right and order is an order.

409
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:47,690
May I remind you that you report to me?

410
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,050
Cool. Just don't ask
me to give a position.

411
00:44:58,540 --> 00:44:59,930
Sorry. Sorry guys.

412
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,553
Hold on.

413
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,650
You sw into a garage like some entitled
prick calling us piss porn and then you

414
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:08,603
drove like that. A swan.

415
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,690
Huh? You saw a swan. What's that mean?

416
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,130
You are an asshole. You come
in like an asshole. You swan.

417
00:45:14,230 --> 00:45:15,530
So swans are assholes.

418
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:20,840
You are making a mistake of thinking that
I'm just going to be some grateful kid

419
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:25,130
who bend the knee to an old timer.
I can't mountain to get here bro.

420
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:26,970
Formula one.

421
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:30,090
Back home. We call that
a participation trophy.

422
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,610
Yeah. What the hell are
you smiling about man?

423
00:45:39,030 --> 00:45:39,863
Did you win something?

424
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,050
There's 20 other drivers still out on
that track and you're in here posing for

425
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,610
that nonsense. Do you think
any of 'em respect us?

426
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:51,810
Do you They need to learn that no
one gets past us without a fight.

427
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:57,690
No one. You don't like
the way I'm driving?

428
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,313
Beat me. Swung.

429
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:29,210
Sorry I didn't see you.

430
00:46:32,380 --> 00:46:33,570
Still beating yourself up.

431
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,033
Yeah.

432
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,250
Yeah, I know that one.

433
00:46:40,550 --> 00:46:42,210
Thanks for what you said out there.

434
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:48,610
Just don't do it again. Okay. It
makes me look like I need help.

435
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,890
Oh man, you're right. Got it.
Hate from what it's worth.

436
00:46:55,060 --> 00:46:57,840
Don't be shitty to yourself. It's plenty
people out there to do that for you.

437
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,553
Yeah.

438
00:47:08,250 --> 00:47:12,810
I am sorry Ruben for demolishing not
one but both of your lovely cards for

439
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:16,410
coming back into your life.
Only to destroy it. Is this
your revenge for Monaco?

440
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,250
Yeah. I waited 30 years and came all
this way to humiliate myself on global

441
00:47:20,250 --> 00:47:21,083
television.

442
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:24,930
Funny you think I brought you
in to make my other driver quit.

443
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,210
Listen, he's cocky, he's
arrogant. He's got a lot to learn.

444
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:34,980
You were talking, you were arrogant and.

445
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,060
You had a lot to learn. I'm not
here to hold anyone's hand here to.

446
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:41,090
Race. No you're not Holly. You're
here to give me a heart attack.

447
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:43,860
The board is up my ass and

448
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:49,610
I have to decide whether to continue
this fiasco or pull the plaque down.

449
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:53,220
You have till the end of the season by
which time Aex will be worth less than my

450
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:54,940
shoes. Sorry.

451
00:47:58,770 --> 00:48:01,610
Tell me about Kate the car.

452
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:04,740
I want to talk to her about the car
world's first female tech director.

453
00:48:05,020 --> 00:48:06,740
F1 team that takes balls.

454
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:11,660
Wow. Is that going to lie? She'll
see right through it. Not lying.

455
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:15,300
I'm sorry. Sorry she married. Okay,

456
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,420
stay there in that top of ice
until Budapest, you don't move.

457
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:26,660
Hey Ruben can't get there with this car.

458
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,780
Hey. Hey. Yeah, sorry. Hi.
Hi. What you working on?

459
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:23,260
I'm working on a new front wing concept
trying to pick us up a 10th or so.

460
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,700
Cool. And you can replicate
turns battery airflow.

461
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,580
No, just straight line drag. But I
mean we can calculate it from there.

462
00:49:31,610 --> 00:49:33,820
Okay, what about turbulent air
from a car we're following?

463
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:36,900
No, not exactly but.

464
00:49:36,950 --> 00:49:40,090
Track conditions, surface
quality, weather, ambient temps.

465
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:43,700
I'm sorry. Is there something
that you wanted to discuss?

466
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,420
Kate, you read my mind.

467
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:54,140
So Alan does want to get to be the
first female technical director of an F1

468
00:49:54,140 --> 00:49:55,220
team. Let's take

469
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,820
dedication. Lots of hard work.

470
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:03,940
That's your urgent question.

471
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,080
Plenty.

472
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:09,610
Of people think I don't belong
here and happy dad you to the list.

473
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,820
If you're implying what I think there's.

474
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,700
A rule. I don't imply stuff.

475
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,020
So you like straight talk.

476
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,060
Stray arrow, no sugar.

477
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:20,610
Everyone thinks Reuben's lost it.
That he's clutching at straws.

478
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,780
They're saying maybe he lost
a bet ran over your dog.

479
00:50:25,010 --> 00:50:29,210
They're saying Sonny
Hayes isn't a has been.

480
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:30,810
He's a never was.

481
00:50:34,590 --> 00:50:38,080
Yeah, when I said I like straight
talk, I meant from others.

482
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:43,040
I mostly prefer praise flattery. Hero
worship at times straight up bullshit. Is.

483
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:43,920
That what Ruben's for?

484
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,200
Reuben. I love the guy
the most solid, steadfast.

485
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:49,360
So you asked if I was married.

486
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:53,240
Disloyal, mean, twisted,
bitter husk of a man.

487
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:53,720
Oh yeah.

488
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:58,640
And he also told me about big
string of ex-wives and girlfriends.

489
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,560
He said to avoid you like the plank.

490
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:04,080
Okay, let me explain this.

491
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:07,400
When you're going 200 miles
per hour into a rouge,

492
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:11,840
it's good to know it's got
your back. For the record,

493
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:12,960
in all my years in racing,

494
00:51:13,240 --> 00:51:17,240
I have never ever hit on
the team technical director.

495
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,800
Well now that's a huge weight off my mind.

496
00:51:25,660 --> 00:51:27,320
So what's this urgent question?

497
00:51:28,190 --> 00:51:32,680
Okay, red Bull, Ferrari,
Mercedes, Aston, dun,

498
00:51:32,790 --> 00:51:36,800
McLaren all have a speed on streamline
speed. Our shot is battling on the turns.

499
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:40,000
I need a way to chase
through the dirty air.

500
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:46,560
You want me to redesign
so you can follow closer?

501
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,240
We need to build our car for combat.

502
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,680
How am I supposed to make that safe?

503
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,960
You said anything not safe.

504
00:51:55,660 --> 00:51:56,640
That's your question.

505
00:51:57,310 --> 00:52:01,440
Yeah and here's the
straight talk. It's urgent.

506
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:12,720
I bet when you look in the
mirror you see this rough and

507
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:17,880
tumble old school, no bullshit.
Cowboy doesn't take orders,

508
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:21,320
goes his own way. Huh? Alone wolf.

509
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,160
Well I have news for you.
Formula one is a team sport.

510
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:29,640
It always was and maybe
that's why you failed at it.

511
00:52:31,060 --> 00:52:34,800
The only question here is why
did so Hayes come back to F1?

512
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:39,000
Now that question is
extremely fucking urgent.

513
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:46,640
I'll start listening to
you when you finish a race.

514
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,430
After the Spanish Grand Prix.

515
00:54:09,450 --> 00:54:14,150
The American rookie Sonny Hayes had just
signed a new contract and his future

516
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:15,430
looked very bright.

517
00:54:15,940 --> 00:54:20,470
He'd earned a reputation for his
aggressive driving style seen by some as

518
00:54:20,710 --> 00:54:21,410
reckless.

519
00:54:21,410 --> 00:54:25,550
It nevertheless served him well as he
climbed up the order over the course of

520
00:54:25,550 --> 00:54:29,230
the season relentlessly
pursuing his first F1 victory.

521
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:35,670
Hayes was running well in the opening
laps chasing down race leader ed and

522
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:36,500
Sena. However,

523
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:41,270
when Hayes made a risky move and attack
centre on the outside of a high speed

524
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,310
right hand turn, a frightening
scene unfolded as quick as a flash.

525
00:54:46,410 --> 00:54:50,830
My goodness, I punch off the right
can see the memory on the right.

526
00:54:50,980 --> 00:54:54,340
What on earth happened
there? I know this very.

527
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:58,670
I must say looks like
he really needs help.

528
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,550
There is nobody coming to at
the moment the flag is out.

529
00:55:21,610 --> 00:55:24,840
Our models predict all teams are
going to be targeting a one-stop race.

530
00:55:25,550 --> 00:55:29,760
Plan A is to switch from mediums
to hards between lab 27 and 33.

531
00:55:30,070 --> 00:55:32,840
Plan B will be medium
hard medium first window,

532
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:37,320
16 to 21 second 45 to 51 plan C for soft.

533
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,880
Doesn't make sense. This temp
the tyre deck will be too high.

534
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,800
Matt Nelson. Yep. Yeah Joshua.

535
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:48,590
So we've just got to drive our race,
right? Let's not try and be heroes.

536
00:55:48,590 --> 00:55:51,000
Let's make it through those
first turns. Clean. Can't win it.

537
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,640
Lap one starting at the back.

538
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,000
So we've just got to hope for
some lucky breaks later on, right?

539
00:55:56,150 --> 00:55:56,670
Yeah.

540
00:55:56,670 --> 00:56:01,560
Yeah. Create your own breaks. Hello. Hi.

541
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:02,633
I just said that.

542
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:04,810
Hope is not a strategy.

543
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:09,930
Anything else Professor.

544
00:56:13,830 --> 00:56:14,110
Try.

545
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:14,943
Fast.

546
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,533
And here

547
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,400
with nowhere to go.

548
00:56:59,590 --> 00:57:03,860
Check my toes. You've got Punctu right
and box. Box Slap first. Got that.

549
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,430
Turn a rule race

550
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:08,950
shit shoot.

551
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:12,910
Let.

552
00:57:12,910 --> 00:57:17,750
Come in. Let's go. Let's go. Plant
C. No plant sees for soft tyres.

553
00:57:17,780 --> 00:57:22,070
They won't last 10 laps in this heat.
No, that's a negative Sunny plan.

554
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:25,150
A is called plan A because when everything
is going right you see anything going

555
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:28,470
right. Plan C soft. It's not his core.

556
00:57:28,620 --> 00:57:32,070
Tell him A as in asshole. Okay,

557
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,790
let's go soft.

558
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:41,120
What's.

559
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:45,560
Wrong with the car? The guy sitting in
it. Are you insane? We need hot tyres.

560
00:57:45,990 --> 00:57:49,520
Everybody here is at a one stop race.
You see what everybody does? We lose

561
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:54,960
make go how you'll say that. Don't.

562
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:55,080
On.

563
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,080
My tyres I was a mechanic. Five champion

564
00:57:59,810 --> 00:58:00,643
hands.

565
00:58:04,530 --> 00:58:06,560
Tyres. Okay, let.

566
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:17,640
Be ready. Ready for what?

567
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,970
Where's Jayson currently running P 14.

568
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:32,810
Alright, here we go. Please make.

569
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:33,793
Move.

570
00:58:38,270 --> 00:58:42,690
Any driver knows Magson will shut
the door on a clumsy move like that.

571
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,090
Glen Sea for chaos.

572
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:50,650
So that will bring out a safety
car which always shakes up a race,

573
00:58:51,060 --> 00:58:56,010
slows down the leads the field together
and gives teeth the chance for a quick

574
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:58,610
pit stop which only costs
half the usual time.

575
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:00,730
Safety car we're box right standby.

576
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:04,090
Gate. Shouldn't we take advantage
while the safety guard window is open?

577
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:05,410
It's early. We gained track.

578
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:06,400
Position if we stay out.

579
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,010
Stay up, stay up. Watch you out.

580
00:59:08,330 --> 00:59:11,610
B, wash Joshua. So the big
deal moves up for the moment.

581
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,090
Where's jp? Now Carly running P 12.

582
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,730
Okay, plan C. Be ready.
He's going to do it again.

583
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:42,970
Hayes is now down the lap. He has to.

584
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:45,690
Let BOTAs pass or face
a five second penalty.

585
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:49,210
Hayes is making it very difficult
for BOTAs under the rules.

586
00:59:49,210 --> 00:59:53,170
He has to let him through before passing
three blue flags or risk of penalty.

587
00:59:53,510 --> 00:59:56,290
Hey I'm just putting it out
there but maybe you should drive.

588
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:02,810
Sonny, you've got the blue flag.
Let bot us through. Come on now.

589
01:00:02,870 --> 01:00:06,850
Little closer. Sonny do you copy?

590
01:00:07,450 --> 01:00:08,770
I hear you through.

591
01:00:11,230 --> 01:00:12,063
My bad.

592
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:17,770
That's going to bring
out another safety win.

593
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:22,730
2000 pounds. I think the team might
all start to start chipping in there.

594
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:30,650
Guys, it's another free stop. Please
tell me what box we are checking.

595
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:34,130
Keep maps. Stay out.
Stay out your stay out.

596
01:00:34,270 --> 01:00:39,170
All drivers come in to take fresh
tyres but still mate on track.

597
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:40,730
He's moved up to B 11.

598
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,513
Look back.

599
01:00:48,850 --> 01:00:50,170
I know, I know. Image.

600
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:54,850
What is he doing?

601
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,610
Think he dream scores a pint.

602
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:04,730
Tell JP to save his tyres Joshua,

603
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:09,090
just take care of your tyres. Okay
You have to make them last lost,

604
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:11,250
no sick a poopy.

605
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:18,850
Before to go in this stop and
go race. Thanks to Sunny Hayes,

606
01:01:18,910 --> 01:01:23,890
the driver helped Moses as his teammate
now in 10 with a 12 second gap ahead

607
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:26,010
of strong. Tell JP.

608
01:01:26,070 --> 01:01:30,570
To maintain that gap. Keep you
pushing. My tyres are gone man.

609
01:01:30,570 --> 01:01:33,930
What are you waiting for? Copy
that. We have to call him.

610
01:01:33,930 --> 01:01:36,690
He's losing over a second
Every lap. Standby.

611
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,690
Seriously, what are we waiting for?

612
01:01:55,830 --> 01:01:57,050
Oopsie. Sorry guys.

613
01:01:57,150 --> 01:02:02,090
That's the third safety car involved with
the a b driver bringing the Hungarian

614
01:02:02,100 --> 01:02:06,850
North Creek to an absolute crawl. A sub
three second. Somebody keep beating.

615
01:02:07,060 --> 01:02:09,610
Let's touch your box. Boss copy coming in.

616
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:17,050
What did you say? Finally gets bit A

617
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:19,883
on top 10.

618
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:43,423
The.

619
01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:57,743
Yes.

620
01:03:09,230 --> 01:03:12,330
You are crazy bro. It's just
10. What are you smiling about?

621
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:20,170
And behind our podium play six Hamilton
of pry complete the top five and kill

622
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:20,470
you.

623
01:03:20,470 --> 01:03:25,410
Be as intense scoring expensive
for XGP their first ever

624
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:26,243
points.

625
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:32,850
Deals. Steel. I finished last.

626
01:03:34,230 --> 01:03:35,730
Sounds great when you say it.

627
01:03:42,170 --> 01:03:43,610
I know you have to go
see the Stewarts later.

628
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:45,410
What do you think they're going
to make of your race today?

629
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:49,090
Well I have to admit you guys got
this one right? I'm like update.

630
01:03:51,110 --> 01:03:55,290
I'm still a bit rusty and finding my way
with this car but I'm confident we'll

631
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:55,530
get it.

632
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,610
A rope. Dope. It's Silverton a
demolition Darby here in Hungary.

633
01:03:59,710 --> 01:04:02,450
You've been banned from casinos. Are
you trying to get banned from F1?

634
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,010
Take the whole team down
with you. Tell you what.

635
01:04:04,010 --> 01:04:07,490
Don, when you say we make a bet
you're 10 pounds against my 10 grand.

636
01:04:07,950 --> 01:04:10,970
We play some Mazda. I win your
10. We don't you wouldn't mind.

637
01:04:11,780 --> 01:04:13,930
Let's do this man. Put your
money where your mouth is.

638
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:18,690
Why the hell I'll take that.
Okay, thank you so much.

639
01:04:19,550 --> 01:04:21,690
Hey no more press.

640
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:25,290
No sorry you don't want to make the
media and you'll be fine. Take it.

641
01:04:25,290 --> 01:04:26,130
Out of my paycheck.

642
01:04:26,830 --> 01:04:28,250
We don't pay you enough up.

643
01:04:29,630 --> 01:04:33,330
You know I have to say I kind of like it.

644
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:38,010
It's very punk rock for the brand.

645
01:04:50,780 --> 01:04:51,650
Let's run it again.

646
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:01,820
How long has he been in that.

647
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:05,500
All day play with different
tyre pressures, ride heights.

648
01:05:07,910 --> 01:05:08,743
Or his times.

649
01:05:09,270 --> 01:05:10,210
He found half second.

650
01:05:15,900 --> 01:05:17,290
Give me the same setup as him.

651
01:05:39,190 --> 01:05:40,650
It must be like I'm seeing double.

652
01:05:43,170 --> 01:05:45,350
Deal's. Deal ner for combat

653
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:51,070
at the Dutch Grand Prix you'll be
entering the tyres and corner at 322

654
01:05:51,070 --> 01:05:52,230
kilometres per hour.

655
01:05:52,860 --> 01:05:54,430
Yeah two legs Change my mind.

656
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:55,973
Yeah,

657
01:06:03,010 --> 01:06:04,110
to answer your question,

658
01:06:04,990 --> 01:06:09,910
I was in aerospace at Lockheed
when Ruben came in and he liked my

659
01:06:09,910 --> 01:06:11,110
work, like my attitude.

660
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:15,510
He sold me on the thrill of fighting
to the death for 10th of a second,

661
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,910
travelling the world a roar of a crowd.

662
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:23,670
So I ran the idea past my husband

663
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:28,430
who swiftly became my ex-husband.

664
01:06:33,930 --> 01:06:34,763
No.

665
01:06:59,890 --> 01:07:01,030
Do you know what time it.

666
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:04,310
Is? Alright, tell me about the kid.

667
01:07:11,820 --> 01:07:15,470
Okay, here's another one. My dad would
say slow is smooth. Smooth is fast.

668
01:07:16,810 --> 01:07:20,950
For what it's worth. One more
time around. Just walk. Come on,

669
01:07:22,620 --> 01:07:24,070
live on live with myself. If.

670
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:27,630
I can't keep up with
you Mr. 1990s, let's go.

671
01:07:28,340 --> 01:07:33,110
Joining us today we have Casper
Smolinski, Zach Brown and Fred Vaser.

672
01:07:33,410 --> 01:07:34,030
Now Casper,

673
01:07:34,030 --> 01:07:37,830
can we start with you after what was a
fantastic result for the team in Hungary

674
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:42,830
last time out but Sonny has got
you skirting the line of penalties

675
01:07:42,830 --> 01:07:43,910
and violations.

676
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:49,470
Is this your only strategy and have
you got any spare parts left in the

677
01:07:49,470 --> 01:07:50,303
factory?

678
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:55,270
We compete like everybody else.
Race models change. We must adapt.

679
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:00,110
Well Zach, can we bring you in on
this because you faced haze before.

680
01:08:00,290 --> 01:08:02,390
You know the grey areas in which he works.

681
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:05,350
Certainly do. First of all,

682
01:08:05,580 --> 01:08:10,390
he's a lot grayer now and we keep
tabs on him back there behind us.

683
01:08:11,370 --> 01:08:15,690
And Fred, any concerns from Ferrari?
What does Ferrari think of Apex?

684
01:08:16,770 --> 01:08:17,603
We don't.

685
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:44,840
A better qualifying yesterday gets
us in the pick of things. P 10, P 15.

686
01:08:45,940 --> 01:08:49,160
So we're going to go for a
two stop, medium, hard medium.

687
01:08:49,260 --> 01:08:51,000
That's plan a final stitch.

688
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,040
We go hard for plan B so unless
do you have any track concerns?

689
01:08:55,210 --> 01:08:57,080
Don't look at me, look at him.

690
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:01,880
It's good for jp. Start me on hearts.

691
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:04,840
Not the tracks cooled down.
You won't have any grip.

692
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:09,350
That's right for three weeks all
the talks been how reckless I am.

693
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:12,840
Everyone's wondering if I'm
going to drive him off track,

694
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:18,350
which means no one's going to
be watching out for him today.

695
01:09:19,770 --> 01:09:20,790
You win us this race.

696
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:42,140
Meanwhile, Hayes is holding up the rest
of the pack stuck behind him in a DS

697
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:49,793
podium

698
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,620
way to go in this race and
potentially forecast anything happen.

699
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:00,020
Cars are coming.

700
01:10:00,040 --> 01:10:00,850
In. Yep,

701
01:10:00,850 --> 01:10:05,850
copy box Brooks is prepping a fresh
set tyres for haze that's going to

702
01:10:05,850 --> 01:10:10,060
bring in all the other things
to avoid the changed my mind.

703
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:15,300
He's out the cars behind on tyres.

704
01:10:16,180 --> 01:10:18,260
Apparently he doesn't
think he needs anymore.

705
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,940
Should we just do the
opposite of what he tells us.

706
01:10:20,940 --> 01:10:25,300
To do? Stand by until I lose
my tyres. We how his tyres,

707
01:10:25,770 --> 01:10:27,140
I think he means literally

708
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:33,020
Archer prayer coming in and there.

709
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:37,900
Goes tyres that's quite on the
track that will bring up the

710
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:38,810
virtual safety.

711
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:43,340
Car for a quick swing so the race gets
neutralised to everyone slows down to

712
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:48,180
40% of their racing speed and all the
race strategies will get a reset and that

713
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:48,980
is why this.

714
01:10:48,980 --> 01:10:52,460
Is the perfect time to take a pit
stock When you're in the pit lane,

715
01:10:52,600 --> 01:10:56,580
your opponents are restricted to a much
slower pace and you're not going to lose

716
01:10:56,580 --> 01:10:59,850
as much track position when
you can joined. Take your
staying out, right Bobby,

717
01:10:59,850 --> 01:11:01,660
Joshua, stay out. Stay out.

718
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:04,020
We want you out to gain
track position, copy.

719
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:17,010
Hay and.

720
01:11:17,010 --> 01:11:17,290
He's.

721
01:11:17,290 --> 01:11:21,850
Come out just in front of wax hay,

722
01:11:22,080 --> 01:11:26,730
slow to midland, which will
cost red Ferrari precious time.

723
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,330
Push Joshua Bush. You want now be four.

724
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,730
Pork Who's coming out behind?

725
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:37,890
Let's see, let's go his.

726
01:11:54,680 --> 01:11:56,890
Back. Yeah.

727
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:09,170
Closed up the front of the,

728
01:12:13,880 --> 01:12:15,730
here comes. Let's see

729
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,890
and to.

730
01:12:27,220 --> 01:12:30,370
Let's get trickier. Hey guys, what's
the plan? You're running P four.

731
01:12:30,390 --> 01:12:34,090
We think P two and P three are switching
to winters for safety and it looks like

732
01:12:34,090 --> 01:12:37,130
you want to stay. What do you want
to do? What's sunny going to do?

733
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:38,650
Take a wild guess.

734
01:12:39,150 --> 01:12:43,850
Of staying out A and then
two Ferraris come in all way.

735
01:12:43,850 --> 01:12:47,090
Intermediate tyres.
Their decides to play it.

736
01:12:49,230 --> 01:12:51,450
Joshua P2.

737
01:12:52,430 --> 01:12:55,770
So Joshua is staying out on slicks.
If you can hold on in find a dry line.

738
01:12:55,960 --> 01:12:58,210
He's going to finish.
Second. Second. Not enough.

739
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:05,580
Okay, coming in for ick, not coming in.

740
01:13:12,120 --> 01:13:13,940
How far behind me are they? 30 seconds.

741
01:13:14,960 --> 01:13:16,580
Oh my god. He's going
to take out for step.

742
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:17,380
Let.

743
01:13:17,380 --> 01:13:19,180
Me know when they hit
the main street. Don't.

744
01:13:19,180 --> 01:13:23,340
Tell him Opinionize both cars. They
will take the win away. Trust me. Clear.

745
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,020
I'm pushing back. I can't catch him.

746
01:13:27,480 --> 01:13:32,060
As the race leaders approach the
main straight is in another standoff

747
01:13:33,140 --> 01:13:33,973
strategy.

748
01:13:48,590 --> 01:13:53,420
Every he hangs on fraction
of a second. Joshua,

749
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,060
one last chance to catch
up. I see him almost.

750
01:13:59,750 --> 01:14:04,460
Peter. Peter, follow me. Kobe, Joshua,
Sonny is your dog. I'm right behind him.

751
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,930
Come on, stay with, stay with me now.

752
01:14:29,640 --> 01:14:33,850
Over overthink Joshua.

753
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:40,210
And now is it striking
distance? One L, jp,

754
01:14:40,310 --> 01:14:44,930
wait for the straighter to turn one.
Be patient straight and turn one.

755
01:14:45,710 --> 01:14:49,850
Joshua Sunny says wait for the
straight. The straight to turn one.

756
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:52,783
I'm right there.

757
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:01,510
For a bit per pie. Aviator,
live casino or top slots?

758
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,510
Za Asan deposit this.

759
01:16:53,470 --> 01:16:54,330
Oh god sake.

760
01:17:05,060 --> 01:17:05,893
How's he doing?

761
01:17:06,840 --> 01:17:08,970
He's stable, he's resting.

762
01:17:10,680 --> 01:17:15,520
Come on, very happy to hear
something. I'm so sorry.

763
01:17:16,160 --> 01:17:16,650
What.

764
01:17:16,650 --> 01:17:19,170
Happened? Sonny over here. Please

765
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:38,190
want to say Joshua said you're an asshole.

766
01:17:41,020 --> 01:17:44,680
You got that track. I think
you're a dangerous asshole

767
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,120
Mrs. Pierce. You're part
of the same team, right?

768
01:17:49,430 --> 01:17:53,760
Looking out for each other except you
had him doing something so dangerous.

769
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:58,560
It almost got him killed. Okay, listen.

770
01:17:58,850 --> 01:18:02,520
No you listen to me. This is my son

771
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,600
and if anything, anything
else happens to him,

772
01:18:06,940 --> 01:18:09,310
I'm coming after you and
you better hurry. I know.

773
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:12,520
Put you in a bed next to Joshua
for a very, very long time.

774
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:39,310
Do you think Joshua blame
you for what happened in.

775
01:18:45,830 --> 01:18:49,440
Come on. It was clear that you
were running his race. Look,

776
01:18:49,440 --> 01:18:53,520
you kept him out on slick tyres in
dangerous conditions that even if you told

777
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:57,680
him not to pass, wasn't the
accident inevitable? I may.

778
01:18:58,480 --> 01:19:00,120
Joshua's back home recovering.

779
01:19:00,500 --> 01:19:03,560
We are expecting to return in
a few weeks until that moment.

780
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:06,680
Our reserve driver Luca
about this right there.

781
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:09,120
We'll drive and next man up.

782
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:18,920
A chaotic week for Expensify Apex
GP and again it's sunny Hayes

783
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:21,800
at the centre. Many are
blaming him for his teammates.

784
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,350
Horrific accident at Monza.

785
01:19:23,700 --> 01:19:28,440
His high stakes gambling style of
racing has the whole grid on edge and

786
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:31,560
while the controversy continues
over who was to blame?

787
01:19:31,870 --> 01:19:36,270
Doctors have said that Pierce will miss
the next three races due to the burn

788
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,640
suffered on his hands as he
begins his road to recovery.

789
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:49,350
Today we're going with our combat upgrade.

790
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:54,560
The revised shapes will improve the flow
field under the floor allowing us to

791
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,600
run in dirty air with minimal loss.

792
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:01,560
Performance means we have to keep
the field close at all times and

793
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:03,960
that for this week's plan C.

794
01:20:10,510 --> 01:20:10,800
Look,

795
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:13,600
they docked us to the back of the grid
because they don't like the way we drive.

796
01:20:14,710 --> 01:20:16,310
Fine fuck 'em.

797
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,160
Because if we can pick up a 10th
of a second from you and from you

798
01:20:22,380 --> 01:20:27,120
and you and me, if everyone in this
room can make one critical contribution,

799
01:20:27,120 --> 01:20:30,310
that's a secondary lap and after 72 laps,

800
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:33,270
that's the difference
between last and first

801
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:39,310
plan C. Plan C is for combat.

802
01:20:44,510 --> 01:20:48,800
Call back, call back,

803
01:20:49,630 --> 01:20:50,560
call back,

804
01:20:52,630 --> 01:20:54,920
call back back.

805
01:22:21,060 --> 01:22:21,893
And.

806
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:35,080
Can't hang on. But this is,

807
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:40,480
it's I love.

808
01:22:43,890 --> 01:22:48,880
Every race you miss fun. Just forget you.
So always seems to be one step ahead.

809
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:55,160
You live below Sonny may be
a Saturn, it may be a Saturn.

810
01:24:00,370 --> 01:24:02,750
The upgrade has completely
changed this car.

811
01:24:03,050 --> 01:24:07,060
And if Joshua is watching what
he must be thinking, what might

812
01:24:13,480 --> 01:24:17,270
treat like a Josh? A be

813
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:19,853
a.

814
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:50,830
That's what up buys breakfast.

815
01:25:16,050 --> 01:25:17,750
We back jp, we missed it.

816
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:38,150
Garage. I got a card just for the under

817
01:25:41,290 --> 01:25:42,123
me.

818
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:05,183
We go.

819
01:26:05,200 --> 01:26:08,090
It's a decent start and keeping it clean.

820
01:26:09,020 --> 01:26:12,520
We go Ferrari ahead of here. The two AP

821
01:26:14,830 --> 01:26:19,370
to work together as a team. It's a
welcome back to the track for Joshua P.

822
01:26:20,510 --> 01:26:23,130
Hay to see him as they slice their weight.

823
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:27,250
Prepositions four and five on
ultimate Camel. Straight we go.

824
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:31,890
Now approaching top
speed, sunny Hayes, Josh,

825
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,050
he's showing effects from that crash.

826
01:26:36,350 --> 01:26:39,770
The cars working beautifully.
They're working as a team.

827
01:26:40,160 --> 01:26:45,010
Hang on to tail using the is he about to

828
01:26:45,020 --> 01:26:49,010
try over into the C We go and wheel

829
01:26:49,910 --> 01:26:54,520
desire rebuild Hayes and into the.

830
01:26:58,120 --> 01:27:00,450
What is happening with this team,

831
01:27:00,810 --> 01:27:04,330
their first race back together
and they ran into each other.

832
01:27:11,870 --> 01:27:13,770
We pull that shit again. I
will knock your teeth out.

833
01:27:13,770 --> 01:27:16,450
Oh no one gets passed us about a
fight, right? Oh, is this funny?

834
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:19,730
You think you've got a seat next year
because you just cut your chances in half.

835
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:21,020
That's how dumb.

836
01:27:21,020 --> 01:27:23,850
You are. You failed. Why should
I listen to you anyway man?

837
01:27:26,520 --> 01:27:27,353
Look man.

838
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:30,450
I don't give two shits about you.
You want to sabotage your career.

839
01:27:30,470 --> 01:27:33,560
You go right ahead. I've seen hundreds
of guys with your talent come and go.

840
01:27:34,030 --> 01:27:38,490
No one cares but you sabotaged
Ruben who backed you.

841
01:27:38,590 --> 01:27:42,490
You sabotaged his team.
I won't let you do it.

842
01:27:47,560 --> 01:27:52,030
Thanks coach. Get your
shit together. So stupid.

843
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,390
How'd you sum up your race today?

844
01:28:03,730 --> 01:28:07,870
Oh it was good. The car feels great.

845
01:28:08,030 --> 01:28:09,510
I think the team's done an amazing job.

846
01:28:10,300 --> 01:28:14,470
It's just a shame of the contact
with Sonny. You hate to see that.

847
01:28:42,750 --> 01:28:43,970
Hey. Hi, how are.

848
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:45,170
You? Good sensation.

849
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:49,890
What is the team brought
this by, gentlemen.

850
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:03,930
Brilliant. You made it. Come on down

851
01:29:06,140 --> 01:29:09,490
Sonny. You know Joshua, Joshua, Sonny.

852
01:29:10,270 --> 01:29:11,890
So I'm sure you both
the heard the rumours.

853
01:29:12,510 --> 01:29:15,890
We all lose our jobs if you can't put
off a miracle and that's starting with

854
01:29:15,890 --> 01:29:17,330
staying on bloody track.

855
01:29:17,990 --> 01:29:21,410
We were doing just fine while JP was out.
I was out. I was listening to you ish.

856
01:29:21,410 --> 01:29:22,970
Please don't call me jp. It's a.

857
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:25,410
Nickname. You don't get to choose
your name. Doesn't even make sense.

858
01:29:25,560 --> 01:29:27,490
I says Sonny is a hazy.
We don't know do we.

859
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:30,560
Lads? Have I not delivered you a car

860
01:29:33,510 --> 01:29:38,130
so you can do one thing
for me. Cards, come on.

861
01:29:38,330 --> 01:29:42,490
I know you haven't yet. It's my team
meeting. We're going to do it my way.

862
01:29:42,490 --> 01:29:44,810
We're playing poker. Yeah,

863
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:48,600
whoever wins gets to be our number one
driver tomorrow and if I win I get to

864
01:29:48,600 --> 01:29:52,930
choose. Did he gamble for a living? Yeah,

865
01:29:53,060 --> 01:29:54,210
now he's living in a van.

866
01:29:56,810 --> 01:29:57,850
Takes us Holden.

867
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:08,170
Forward. Yeah.

868
01:30:12,270 --> 01:30:15,930
So Sony here like straight
talk that right Sunny?

869
01:30:16,120 --> 01:30:17,210
Yeah, that's what I hear.

870
01:30:17,430 --> 01:30:19,490
So let's talk. Who wants to go first?

871
01:30:19,680 --> 01:30:20,770
I'll go. I'll go first.

872
01:30:21,710 --> 01:30:26,130
No, I'll go first. What's the difference
between Joshua Pierce and Sunny Hayes?

873
01:30:26,930 --> 01:30:30,810
A lot of decades Hard one experience
of living in a van. Total freedom.

874
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:34,410
Total failure says the guy
still lives with his mom.

875
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:37,370
Says a guy with two pair
says the guy with trips.

876
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:42,050
Says the guy with a full house. Girl.

877
01:30:43,720 --> 01:30:47,890
Wait, I don't even live with my mom,
okay, she just looks for me sometimes.

878
01:30:51,590 --> 01:30:54,170
Did I need constructive criticism
for each other? What would it be?

879
01:30:54,240 --> 01:30:59,090
Doug be such an a kid
that was constructive.

880
01:31:02,150 --> 01:31:06,770
You have a deficient
frontal cortex. Oh what?

881
01:31:06,910 --> 01:31:08,890
You can't analyse risk.
It's not all your fault,

882
01:31:09,040 --> 01:31:11,050
it's not fully formed yet your age,

883
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:15,130
but come the day you learn patience
and stop being so mature. Thinking.

884
01:31:16,450 --> 01:31:19,210
Patience is good. Patience Joshua.

885
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,410
He doesn't care about what anyone
else has to say about himself.

886
01:31:23,430 --> 01:31:26,130
He just comes in and imposes his
will on one of us with no discussion.

887
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:29,370
He doesn't listen. I'm
trying but he doesn't listen.

888
01:31:31,800 --> 01:31:33,170
Sony, what.

889
01:31:51,910 --> 01:31:52,130
The.

890
01:31:52,130 --> 01:31:56,730
Tool you have to play. My dad liked
to gamble. He made big bench too.

891
01:31:56,990 --> 01:31:57,890
Put a big one on me.

892
01:31:58,430 --> 01:31:59,930
How old were you? You
when your fathers died?

893
01:32:05,100 --> 01:32:05,933
Sorry.

894
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:06,923
18.

895
01:32:09,750 --> 01:32:12,740
Huh? Why do you raise.

896
01:32:13,270 --> 01:32:15,500
Money, fame and free clothes.

897
01:32:17,600 --> 01:32:20,180
Oh my god. With the phone. Put
the thing down. Will. Yeah.

898
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:23,340
What do you care what they say? Easy
for you to say they'll love you.

899
01:32:23,560 --> 01:32:26,900
It's just noise man. Drive the car.

900
01:32:27,680 --> 01:32:28,900
You're really good at it.

901
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:32,793
You might be great.

902
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:54,340
Hi. This is,

903
01:33:14,600 --> 01:33:16,620
yeah, look at that.

904
01:33:16,960 --> 01:33:21,700
Huh? Number one driver tomorrow.
Funding. Oh, this is nice.

905
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:26,380
You've got a go sponsor by
Omni G. Steal you uncle.

906
01:33:26,480 --> 01:33:30,900

I'm good. I a race tomorrow. Cool. Kate.

907
01:33:31,560 --> 01:33:36,060
No thank you. Come on. Thanks
for this Kate. Come on back

908
01:33:37,590 --> 01:33:40,460
girls. You might have, we're
going to go dancing. Dancing.

909
01:33:54,350 --> 01:33:58,020
Listen, let's get this straight. Okay.

910
01:33:58,810 --> 01:34:02,420
I don't mess around during the season
and never with a member of my team and

911
01:34:02,420 --> 01:34:06,140
what I'm attracted to is winning
and you just lost a pair of fives.

912
01:35:06,710 --> 01:35:11,290
Hey, you're a driver. Are you? Yeah.

913
01:35:11,500 --> 01:35:11,850
Which.

914
01:35:11,850 --> 01:35:15,890
Date? Apex gp. Can you
introduce me to Carlos sign?

915
01:35:18,160 --> 01:35:18,993
I'll go get.

916
01:35:27,270 --> 01:35:32,010
Why he say this place is weird. I
like this bro. Going to leave here.

917
01:35:32,690 --> 01:35:34,690
I said I'm going to come just.

918
01:35:37,470 --> 01:35:38,303
Bro.

919
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:37,643
Hey.

920
01:36:40,850 --> 01:36:43,640
Oh shouldn't drink tequila.

921
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,730
Last time was Ruben's idea.

922
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,090
Yeah, the first part.

923
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:52,873
What?

924
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:53,893
Not the second.

925
01:37:05,790 --> 01:37:09,720
Come on. Why are you here? Sunny? Huh?

926
01:37:13,150 --> 01:37:14,130
I'm not much of a story.

927
01:37:21,040 --> 01:37:25,340
Okay. I am here to prove everyone wrong.

928
01:37:27,730 --> 01:37:29,870
My ex, my old boss,

929
01:37:32,010 --> 01:37:34,350
my first year uni physics professor. That.

930
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:34,810
Bastard.

931
01:37:34,810 --> 01:37:39,590
Yeah. And I'm telling we win. I haven't

932
01:37:41,410 --> 01:37:45,190
so unfortunately I now rely on you.

933
01:37:52,390 --> 01:37:56,730
That was going to be world
champion best there ever was

934
01:37:58,760 --> 01:38:01,010
just a kid along the track with my idols.

935
01:38:01,200 --> 01:38:04,600
Senator Manson Pros and I am quick,

936
01:38:06,510 --> 01:38:10,330
I'm fearless. I was next

937
01:38:14,190 --> 01:38:15,023
and then

938
01:38:18,530 --> 01:38:19,710
it was all taken away.

939
01:38:22,470 --> 01:38:23,303
Crash.

940
01:38:25,310 --> 01:38:28,420
So asked my seat, my money, my sanity,

941
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:33,150
my self really became miss,

942
01:38:34,700 --> 01:38:37,490
angry, resentful, shithead.

943
01:38:39,270 --> 01:38:40,770
Not something I'm particularly proud of.

944
01:38:45,590 --> 01:38:50,170
The one day I realised what I'd really
lost and it wasn't the titles or the

945
01:38:50,490 --> 01:38:53,560
trophies or the records. It was

946
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:55,963
I love for racing

947
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:02,600
so I started driving.
Didn't matter the car,

948
01:39:02,780 --> 01:39:06,760
the circuit didn't need anyone to watch.
As long as I was behind the wheel,

949
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:08,400
I was good.

950
01:39:12,470 --> 01:39:13,303
Sometimes

951
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:25,683
come on.

952
01:39:29,460 --> 01:39:34,430
It's rare but sometimes
there's this moment in

953
01:39:34,430 --> 01:39:37,190
the car where everything goes quiet,

954
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:39,590
my heart beat slows.

955
01:39:41,540 --> 01:39:46,030
It's peaceful and I can
see everything and no one,

956
01:39:47,130 --> 01:39:48,190
no one can touch me.

957
01:39:51,950 --> 01:39:54,390
I am chasing that moment
every time I get in the car.

958
01:39:57,960 --> 01:40:02,120
I don't know when I'll find
it again but man, I want to,

959
01:40:03,600 --> 01:40:08,470
I want because in that moment I'm.

960
01:40:31,500 --> 01:40:32,333
Eight.

961
01:40:33,100 --> 01:40:33,790
Ruben.

962
01:40:33,790 --> 01:40:34,623
Where is he?

963
01:40:35,430 --> 01:40:38,050
Who's who? What are you talking about

964
01:40:40,220 --> 01:40:45,210
Ruben? Seriously. One. How dare you? Two.

965
01:40:45,930 --> 01:40:49,130
I respect professional
boundaries and three.

966
01:40:51,850 --> 01:40:53,410
Three. Yeah, he's on the balcony.

967
01:40:56,800 --> 01:40:58,370
Well you're up early. Good dressed.

968
01:40:58,440 --> 01:40:59,050
Yeah, what's.

969
01:40:59,050 --> 01:41:00,650
Going on? They're coming for our car.

970
01:41:04,440 --> 01:41:07,560
It's my duty to inform you that we've
received an anonymous tip that your

971
01:41:07,560 --> 01:41:10,010
upgrade floor is in violation. From.

972
01:41:10,030 --> 01:41:13,170
Who? I can't say, oh sir,

973
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:17,930
we submitted the drawings long
ago and you approved them all.

974
01:41:18,310 --> 01:41:21,930
It's whether departures are racing with
were developed outside of your facility.

975
01:41:23,040 --> 01:41:26,170
What? That's insane. Based
on the paperwork we've
received, there are concerns.

976
01:41:26,680 --> 01:41:29,850
Hang on. Where'd you get? These
are internal documents. This.

977
01:41:29,850 --> 01:41:31,330
Thing doesn't break any rules sir?

978
01:41:31,760 --> 01:41:33,330
I'll say that when you can just, someone.

979
01:41:33,470 --> 01:41:34,303
Can fabricate.

980
01:41:34,560 --> 01:41:37,290
Documents your cars under
review. You know the procedure.

981
01:41:37,630 --> 01:41:41,850
You cannot race unless you substitute
the previously approved components.

982
01:41:42,230 --> 01:41:44,050
No. Do you mean our old design.

983
01:41:44,330 --> 01:41:44,450
A.

984
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:45,283
Sheet box?

985
01:41:45,510 --> 01:41:48,530
No. Where were you in the
last two years? Why not?

986
01:41:48,530 --> 01:41:52,170
Because we might actually win a race.
Is that it? This is not car race.

987
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,730
This is like corporate as I'm
sorry. I'm sorry. Come here.

988
01:41:56,270 --> 01:41:58,930
I'm talking to you sir, we the.

989
01:41:58,930 --> 01:41:59,763
Upgrade. Were screwed.

990
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:31,630
Sonny. Let it go. Focus on a clean
start. We'll never win clean.

991
01:42:32,490 --> 01:42:36,350
Can we just not break any rules? Yeah,
the rules are always against us though.

992
01:42:36,350 --> 01:42:37,183
Aren't they?

993
01:42:40,230 --> 01:42:41,530
Get them safe through lap one.

994
01:42:42,660 --> 01:42:45,370
Sonny? We just need to
keep it in one piece. Okay.

995
01:43:16,750 --> 01:43:17,000
Boy.

996
01:43:17,000 --> 01:43:21,560
What the hell? I know what's
wrong with son Joshua. Yeah,

997
01:43:21,560 --> 01:43:23,850
keep focus. You're so
good. What's she doing?

998
01:43:32,750 --> 01:43:33,850
Not good. It's not good.

999
01:43:41,060 --> 01:43:43,650
Sunny, when you take this time,
these tyres last, take it easy.

1000
01:43:51,670 --> 01:43:51,960
Oh.

1001
01:43:51,960 --> 01:43:53,530
He's put the in qualified mode.

1002
01:43:53,680 --> 01:43:57,690
He's going to run the battery to
put it back mode. What's going on?

1003
01:43:59,310 --> 01:44:00,143
What's happening?

1004
01:45:07,340 --> 01:45:08,280
Why do either this?

1005
01:45:10,220 --> 01:45:13,560
What's wrong with Tanya's or golf?

1006
01:45:22,540 --> 01:45:23,480
We don't leave.

1007
01:45:29,520 --> 01:45:33,910
C five. Neck fracture, spinal condition,

1008
01:45:34,600 --> 01:45:38,060
compressed thoracic
vertebra. Further blunt.

1009
01:45:38,060 --> 01:45:42,510
Force in pet trauma likely to
result in vision loss paralysis.

1010
01:45:42,640 --> 01:45:43,473
Death deaf

1011
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,510
really leading with the
good news, don't they?

1012
01:45:49,100 --> 01:45:53,790
This is a report from 30 years
ago. Why didn't you tell me

1013
01:45:57,050 --> 01:45:58,790
you never struck have raced again. So

1014
01:46:00,930 --> 01:46:02,790
how do you think I'd feel
if you die on the truck

1015
01:46:05,100 --> 01:46:07,750
revenge from Monica? It's not a joke.

1016
01:46:11,170 --> 01:46:15,100
It's made. Who's liable? Sunny. I
don't think there's some bullshit.

1017
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:19,060
Put hot to get you out of this. No
remember drivers, we're not drivers.

1018
01:46:19,240 --> 01:46:23,940
Not anymore. I'm sorry,
we're not. We're losers.

1019
01:46:25,990 --> 01:46:28,940
We're a pair of dumb sentimental

1020
01:46:30,910 --> 01:46:31,850
broke losers.

1021
01:46:37,730 --> 01:46:39,020
Okay, you're off the team.

1022
01:46:44,810 --> 01:46:46,510
You're vanishing the garage with all.

1023
01:46:54,770 --> 01:46:58,850
I never should forward you
into this honey. I'm sorry.

1024
01:47:01,910 --> 01:47:02,743
You can wait.

1025
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:09,923
I need this.

1026
01:47:13,350 --> 01:47:17,290
No one drives forever.
Sunny. Not even you.

1027
01:47:31,790 --> 01:47:35,730
Pepper load up Monza just like it happened

1028
01:47:37,030 --> 01:47:37,863
in the rain.

1029
01:47:51,350 --> 01:47:52,210
Run again. Please

1030
01:48:02,790 --> 01:48:03,770
run again please.

1031
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:50,500
Sunny. Hey you're not Abu Dhabi.

1032
01:48:50,660 --> 01:48:53,980
I fly out tonight. Yeah,
I wanted to catch you.

1033
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:56,393
So listen,

1034
01:48:57,160 --> 01:49:00,850
we both know that the boards wanted
to unload Apex from the start,

1035
01:49:01,760 --> 01:49:04,700
but yeah, then you brought into town,

1036
01:49:04,700 --> 01:49:09,540
raised our whole profile and
now I've got buyers lining

1037
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:13,620
up. Got to be honest with you man,

1038
01:49:13,620 --> 01:49:16,300
I thought you were going to be
the final nail in the coffin,

1039
01:49:17,160 --> 01:49:22,100
but now I see the play and I
want you as part of the package,

1040
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:26,850
what sort of package?

1041
01:49:28,010 --> 01:49:31,980
I've set up a sale where I run the
team and keep you on for strategy,

1042
01:49:33,030 --> 01:49:37,300
maybe even team principle
with the money from that deal.

1043
01:49:37,810 --> 01:49:39,340
I can make you a very rich man.

1044
01:49:40,760 --> 01:49:45,540
Here's the thing with the changing in
regulations, new Mercedes Power Unit,

1045
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:47,370
Kate's arrow, two new drivers.

1046
01:49:49,140 --> 01:49:53,290
We've got a real shot of the
championship next year. What about Ruben?

1047
01:49:53,940 --> 01:49:58,010
Don't worry, we won't embarrass him.

1048
01:49:58,810 --> 01:50:02,690
We'll keep him on with a title
or brand ambassador. Something

1049
01:50:07,600 --> 01:50:10,930
I get final say don't change
a thing. Do what you do man.

1050
01:50:12,270 --> 01:50:13,370
And that's the irony here.

1051
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:17,810
The board originally approved your hire
because we thought you would help us

1052
01:50:17,810 --> 01:50:20,330
lose. Sorry to make you sweat. Hey

1053
01:50:21,970 --> 01:50:25,350
that's my number taught your people. But

1054
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:32,270
right after the race I want to lock
down the deal. Okay? So by Sunday,

1055
01:50:32,980 --> 01:50:36,710
perfect. Listen this
thing can be your legacy.

1056
01:50:39,650 --> 01:50:43,350
An F1 champion what you
always wanted, right?

1057
01:50:47,170 --> 01:50:51,030
It was you for those
documents wasn't it? Huh?

1058
01:50:56,970 --> 01:50:57,990
You're a killer man.

1059
01:50:58,030 --> 01:51:02,430
I am. I'm a winner on you. Huh?

1060
01:51:06,180 --> 01:51:10,870
Okay. Oh hey,

1061
01:51:11,600 --> 01:51:15,150
how's the back better?
I've got an amazing guy.

1062
01:51:16,100 --> 01:51:19,350
I'll hook you up. Hey Mary.

1063
01:51:47,210 --> 01:51:48,043
You good?

1064
01:51:54,530 --> 01:51:56,470
Listen mom, I got to tell you something.

1065
01:52:00,770 --> 01:52:05,270
In Monzo right before the crash
it was my decision to make a move.

1066
01:52:07,450 --> 01:52:08,283
So I didn't tell.

1067
01:52:17,880 --> 01:52:21,270
Emily. I've been working
the phones with IndyCar.

1068
01:52:21,470 --> 01:52:22,910
I think I can get you a test drive bro.

1069
01:52:25,660 --> 01:52:28,230
They're trying to pull in a
new demographic obviously.

1070
01:52:28,690 --> 01:52:33,350
And the ladies that love that smile
I throwing some incentives like

1071
01:52:33,380 --> 01:52:35,710
flights and cars.
Listen, cash, you can go.

1072
01:52:35,750 --> 01:52:38,950
I don't need you today. Oh
mate, you've got media next.

1073
01:52:40,350 --> 01:52:43,060
I don't care. They could find me besides,

1074
01:52:44,770 --> 01:52:48,490
that's not why I'm doing it,
right Josh? Starting tomorrow.

1075
01:52:48,540 --> 01:52:52,370
We're not doing it anywhere.
It's all just noise.

1076
01:52:53,810 --> 01:52:56,970
Media engagement, followers. Listen,

1077
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:03,050
I've got to focus on
the race Auntie, please.

1078
01:53:04,920 --> 01:53:05,970
Will you hurt the man?

1079
01:53:21,150 --> 01:53:24,490
Yo. Hey. Hi. Hey.

1080
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:32,450
Guys, what's happening? Park family
waiting for FIA to cut the seals.

1081
01:53:32,870 --> 01:53:37,450
Oh good. We got time then. For what?

1082
01:53:38,910 --> 01:53:39,743
For?

1083
01:53:43,630 --> 01:53:44,463
No, no.

1084
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:52,930
Welcome to the palette club.
For our most valued guests,

1085
01:53:53,190 --> 01:53:55,370
please grab a drink,

1086
01:53:55,680 --> 01:54:00,050
make yourselves at home and
enjoy the very best view there is

1087
01:54:00,750 --> 01:54:01,583
of Formula one.

1088
01:55:11,140 --> 01:55:13,600
Hey Jesus, it's like a mortar around here.

1089
01:55:16,900 --> 01:55:19,040
How you get here. Premium economy.

1090
01:55:23,630 --> 01:55:24,840
What is this?

1091
01:55:25,470 --> 01:55:27,800
Well that's my bullshit
loophole. I don't forget it.

1092
01:55:27,820 --> 01:55:28,800
I'm not even going to read that.

1093
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:33,560
That is a real legal document from a
real Tijuana lawyer WA all li ability to

1094
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:37,840
you and your company vis-a-vis
this race. Myself and me. And

1095
01:55:41,290 --> 01:55:44,250
since you owe me my last paycheck,
technically I'm still on this team.

1096
01:55:50,060 --> 01:55:51,230
Kate, where's the shit box?

1097
01:55:51,890 --> 01:55:55,550
The FIA confirmed that the documents
were forged and they were sent by someone

1098
01:55:55,550 --> 01:55:56,383
from Apex.

1099
01:55:59,760 --> 01:56:03,120
I don't care about your loophole.
I don't. That is my car.

1100
01:56:03,220 --> 01:56:06,280
You are not raising it.
Really? No, Sonny is it?

1101
01:56:08,360 --> 01:56:10,800
I can't let you do that. I can't.

1102
01:56:11,270 --> 01:56:15,860
Okay, the last thing I
do is drive that car.

1103
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:17,220
I will take that life man.

1104
01:56:21,540 --> 01:56:22,373
A thousand times.

1105
01:56:27,680 --> 01:56:31,780
We can't win. We can if we don't try.

1106
01:57:18,370 --> 01:57:19,550
How come you never look at a card?

1107
01:57:20,220 --> 01:57:21,053
What card?

1108
01:58:02,210 --> 01:58:05,820
Welcome to the very final spots
on the grid and as ever will go

1109
01:58:07,970 --> 01:58:10,900
here in P 22 because we're
here in the Apex. GP team.

1110
01:58:11,520 --> 01:58:13,980
The late stage driver
switch. That's your guy,

1111
01:58:13,990 --> 01:58:18,260
isn't it being replaced by Hayes
who didn't even make the trip to.

1112
01:58:33,280 --> 01:58:34,113
You. Got my phone.

1113
01:58:53,520 --> 01:58:54,650
Good luck to about you too James.

1114
01:58:55,070 --> 01:58:56,410
Hey Sunny. Hey look,

1115
01:58:56,410 --> 01:59:00,130
I know we brought out different team but
look this is your last yes half far and

1116
01:59:00,210 --> 01:59:01,043
thought.

1117
01:59:03,360 --> 01:59:04,193
What's that?

1118
01:59:08,720 --> 01:59:12,600
Bloody hell. Bloody hell.

1119
01:59:38,460 --> 01:59:41,280
All set for our season finale here in

1120
01:59:44,230 --> 01:59:46,600
away we Joshua

1121
01:59:49,040 --> 01:59:50,080
position as we.

1122
02:00:45,600 --> 02:00:46,433
Inside.

1123
02:00:48,240 --> 02:00:50,820
And three days out
before Hazel. Feel that.

1124
02:01:01,250 --> 02:01:03,100
Game guys we're alive.

1125
02:01:03,420 --> 02:01:06,820
I hope he hasn't damaged the car but
despite everything it's still a great,

1126
02:01:07,770 --> 02:01:08,603
it's.

1127
02:01:08,940 --> 02:01:12,340
P 16 PS P nine

1128
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:19,380
Mercedes Ferrari holding onto
the lead eight in the big field.

1129
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:22,300
Let's see if they can do
anything to shake up this race.

1130
02:01:22,640 --> 02:01:24,740
Get leader 16 seconds.

1131
02:01:25,770 --> 02:01:27,260
Keep JP plus 20 seconds.

1132
02:01:27,690 --> 02:01:30,780
Plus 20 Alexis pit though you know why.

1133
02:01:32,370 --> 02:01:34,180
It's a busy race for Sunny Hayes.

1134
02:01:34,440 --> 02:01:38,060
And now here comes Kevin Anderson
looking to make a move and this.

1135
02:01:39,040 --> 02:01:40,690
There's history between the two.

1136
02:01:40,690 --> 02:01:45,650
Often the era hot force
meets the I object looking

1137
02:01:45,790 --> 02:01:48,370
at inside and hits hay.

1138
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:51,303
Coming in

1139
02:01:55,800 --> 02:01:58,730
slow is smooth, smooth
it's fast. Here we go.

1140
02:02:06,540 --> 02:02:10,360
Hey, exit the fence. He had to come
in because of that damage to his tyre.

1141
02:02:10,550 --> 02:02:13,800
Thought of Joshua Pierce.
Where do a GP go with

1142
02:02:16,190 --> 02:02:17,023
guys?

1143
02:02:21,690 --> 02:02:25,600
Chaos. Copy that. Joshua slows
down the metre for Sunny.

1144
02:02:25,900 --> 02:02:27,040
So does ING for him.

1145
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:32,480
Strategy this season

1146
02:02:34,360 --> 02:02:36,760
position for now only got
to keep these tyres alive.

1147
02:02:40,670 --> 02:02:44,960
It's the only way we keep this close
and then we need luck. Aren't we ahead.

1148
02:02:44,960 --> 02:02:45,793
Here?

1149
02:02:48,560 --> 02:02:53,340
Lap 25 and every driver so far is
Pit Paul one and he leads the race.

1150
02:02:53,440 --> 02:02:54,380
Joshua Fierce.

1151
02:02:54,770 --> 02:02:59,660
Controlling the pace out in front and
that gives his teammate Hayes a chance to

1152
02:02:59,900 --> 02:03:03,820
maintain his position in the midfield.
Despite the contact puncture and pit.

1153
02:03:04,330 --> 02:03:08,940
They're working really well
together. What we doing up there?

1154
02:03:09,170 --> 02:03:10,460
He's keeping the leaders at bay.

1155
02:03:10,980 --> 02:03:11,820
DRS academic.

1156
02:03:12,060 --> 02:03:16,060
Straight sunny, got it
onto the back straight.

1157
02:03:16,570 --> 02:03:20,620
He's enjoying this new
upgrade and he's, he's got.

1158
02:03:24,910 --> 02:03:26,620
Sonny, you have got the pace. Keep pushing

1159
02:03:29,970 --> 02:03:32,900
despite, but that moment is nearly over.

1160
02:03:33,610 --> 02:03:36,900
Snap up the inside and
he's through. Fabulous.

1161
02:03:36,900 --> 02:03:41,500
First in from Joshua Pierce. Max
is passed and his down there.

1162
02:03:42,730 --> 02:03:47,700
Here comes it's overtake trucks

1163
02:03:47,760 --> 02:03:52,300
now to P three guys. My
tyres shot. Copy that box.

1164
02:03:52,360 --> 02:03:53,080
JP box.

1165
02:03:53,080 --> 02:03:56,900
Box Pierce stretching those tyres to the

1166
02:04:08,460 --> 02:04:10,960
and he exits. The he'll
have pressure ties.

1167
02:04:11,660 --> 02:04:15,380
Now attack in second of the race Sonny.

1168
02:04:15,380 --> 02:04:16,820
The three leaders are still on the hard.

1169
02:04:16,820 --> 02:04:18,780
They're going to have to stop
again. This is the pit window.

1170
02:04:18,890 --> 02:04:21,540
What are the leaders going to undercut?
I need to beat there when they do

1171
02:04:23,090 --> 02:04:23,923
need three.

1172
02:04:23,940 --> 02:04:25,540
Ferrari ppa. Could he beat it to one?

1173
02:04:28,250 --> 02:04:29,260
Depends on their stop.

1174
02:04:31,450 --> 02:04:33,580
5.8 he needs to pick up half a second.

1175
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,330
So you need half a second go.

1176
02:04:38,030 --> 02:04:43,010
So Hayes is on the charge track
Ra through the first corner.

1177
02:04:43,390 --> 02:04:46,490
So Hayes, it's really tight.

1178
02:04:47,190 --> 02:04:48,770
So Hayes is ahead

1179
02:04:54,960 --> 02:04:55,810
down the inside,

1180
02:04:55,920 --> 02:05:00,690
there's a chance sight and he
takes it and he looks up the

1181
02:05:00,890 --> 02:05:05,490
Ferrari goes away and says
thank you very much indeed.

1182
02:05:07,860 --> 02:05:08,310
Stage.

1183
02:05:08,310 --> 02:05:12,330
Are close to the league.
They're working together.

1184
02:05:13,270 --> 02:05:15,890
Two big cars in the top 10, but still a.

1185
02:05:15,890 --> 02:05:19,970
Long way to go. 20 laps remaining.

1186
02:05:19,970 --> 02:05:24,370
Eight has worked their way up the order.
We're now at the final pit stop window.

1187
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:27,530
This our chance for P one.
Make sure JP beats 'em up.

1188
02:05:27,850 --> 02:05:31,730
Hamilton and Le Claire come into
the pit. Look here. Stays out.

1189
02:05:33,120 --> 02:05:36,850
Tuck to me. Can I catch him? Yeah, they're
just coming out. Push now. Push now.

1190
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,650
Push. Push. Copy, push it.
Oh this is going to be Joshua

1191
02:05:44,710 --> 02:05:47,930
second this, let's go.

1192
02:05:50,790 --> 02:05:51,623
Joshua

1193
02:05:53,720 --> 02:05:58,090
will have a hard time holding him
on with Hamilton and on Fresh tyres.

1194
02:06:07,640 --> 02:06:12,050
Four out to go Sunny haters in P four.
He's five seconds behind his teammate,

1195
02:06:12,230 --> 02:06:16,450
but both through all tyres. There's
little chance they'll gain any places now.

1196
02:06:19,150 --> 02:06:22,330
And here's Hamilton Attack
appears in the turn five.

1197
02:06:22,910 --> 02:06:27,370
And he's through. Nobody has to stop
again on our tyres in nine laps over.

1198
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:31,890
Nuclear attacks and passes.

1199
02:06:32,470 --> 02:06:36,890
Pierce his tyres absolutely finished.
There's nothing you can do about that.

1200
02:06:37,620 --> 02:06:37,960
I'm sorry.

1201
02:06:37,960 --> 02:06:40,120
Guys of got nothing been left.

1202
02:06:40,710 --> 02:06:43,880
There's been the apex
cheap story all year long.

1203
02:06:43,980 --> 02:06:48,000
Plenty of risks are great.
Underdog story, but we don't.

1204
02:06:48,000 --> 02:06:50,960
Need talent. Crowns a champion,
those grip tyres are gone. Yeah,

1205
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:55,320
sadly the deck's been stacked against
them and now they're out of cards to play.

1206
02:06:55,420 --> 02:06:56,360
It ain't over, right?

1207
02:06:56,540 --> 02:06:59,520
No, but nothing can change. It's
the worst. Failing in the world.

1208
02:07:13,980 --> 02:07:15,040
That's a big one.

1209
02:07:22,490 --> 02:07:25,470
All over the racetrack. And
substantial damage to the barriers.

1210
02:07:25,650 --> 02:07:29,830
The stewards have no choice but
to red flag this race miracle.

1211
02:07:30,290 --> 02:07:31,790
And speaking of damage, Martin.

1212
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:34,310
He's won to be allowed
to continue in this race.

1213
02:07:34,730 --> 02:07:39,250
If we could get his car all the way around
the circuit and back to the pit lane.

1214
02:07:40,140 --> 02:07:43,970
Sonny. Sonny, can you get it back?
I'll get it back. I'll get it back.

1215
02:07:44,050 --> 02:07:44,883
I have to push him back.

1216
02:07:52,790 --> 02:07:56,970
He still going? He's
still going. Jp. Red flag.

1217
02:07:57,350 --> 02:08:00,210
Red flag. Come in. We're
still alive. Armando.

1218
02:08:02,870 --> 02:08:03,703
Red flag.

1219
02:08:04,470 --> 02:08:09,410
And somehow Sunny Hayes has got his
car back to the pit lane Sun. I know,

1220
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:11,010
I know. Never seen one.

1221
02:08:12,370 --> 02:08:16,390
Free Good girl. Let's go. New shops,

1222
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:18,710
both cars race the tyre
pressure for three quick.

1223
02:08:18,900 --> 02:08:19,733
Laps.

1224
02:08:21,170 --> 02:08:24,310
Car red flag horses. The
teams can make changes,

1225
02:08:24,340 --> 02:08:27,630
they can make repairs to their
cars, but only in that pen lane.

1226
02:08:28,050 --> 02:08:31,950
And with only 10 minutes to make
repairs. He makes GP has their.

1227
02:08:31,950 --> 02:08:36,470
Work cut out and all cars
can fit a fresh set of tyres

1228
02:08:36,930 --> 02:08:41,590
for the three Sprint. Dad. Dad,
we going to make it? I don't know.

1229
02:08:47,740 --> 02:08:51,470
That was clean. That wasn't mean.
Not this time. Not this time.

1230
02:08:52,580 --> 02:08:56,870
Tell that to the stewards.
Check the replay. I got this.

1231
02:09:06,570 --> 02:09:08,790
I'm good. Good, good, good.

1232
02:09:09,420 --> 02:09:13,190
What the stewards will be looking at
is whether Hayes went off completely or

1233
02:09:13,190 --> 02:09:17,830
kept at least one tyre on track during
the contact with Russell. Yo, you good?

1234
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:20,990
Yeah. Good. Listen, you
are on track and it was.

1235
02:09:20,990 --> 02:09:24,230
Your corner P three and P four.
Let's go. Cuban Hayes reputation.

1236
02:09:24,300 --> 02:09:26,910
They'll be looking at this
really, really closely.

1237
02:09:27,450 --> 02:09:30,190
I'm not expecting a quick decision.
Come on. That's clearly a.

1238
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:32,630
Penalty. Not that that's what we want,

1239
02:09:32,690 --> 02:09:35,990
but objectively that's the guy.

1240
02:09:36,670 --> 02:09:38,150
I glad it can't end this way. He.

1241
02:09:38,150 --> 02:09:40,110
Has the timeout like the last 30 years.

1242
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:44,710
It's in the hands of the racing God
stuff. Going to believe. God believe.

1243
02:09:46,370 --> 02:09:48,870
Plenty going on here in the pit. Oh.

1244
02:09:48,900 --> 02:09:52,390
Here comes the new wing.
This is a massive job. Yeah,

1245
02:09:52,410 --> 02:09:55,350
but will the car hold together
for the remaining three hours?

1246
02:09:58,960 --> 02:10:02,910
Blood. Mario looks okay now the
marshals just sweeping the mastery.

1247
02:10:02,910 --> 02:10:06,670
Bits of debris off the track and
the club continues to take down.

1248
02:10:07,050 --> 02:10:10,270
Yes, just over two minutes until
this race gets underway again.

1249
02:10:34,300 --> 02:10:38,570
Three laps. Three laps is a
lifetime. Go win this thing.

1250
02:10:50,690 --> 02:10:52,750
Hey sunny, sunny. You got a minute?

1251
02:10:55,080 --> 02:10:57,100
We got you a car. Oh.

1252
02:10:57,240 --> 02:10:58,900
You broke. Thank you.

1253
02:11:01,840 --> 02:11:04,850
Because Apex GP didn't
make the top 10 in qualify,

1254
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:10,410
they have a new set of soft tyres
available which will give them X speed

1255
02:11:10,410 --> 02:11:13,490
over the cars ahead of them,
of the used soft tyres.

1256
02:11:14,360 --> 02:11:19,170
This red flag is a lifeline. You'd
almost wonder if Stanley didn't engineer.

1257
02:11:19,190 --> 02:11:20,023
It,

1258
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:24,650
but we are the only cars on fresh tyres
because we sucked in qualify yesterday.

1259
02:11:25,060 --> 02:11:28,490
Never got the chance to use them.
Sometimes when you lose, you win.

1260
02:11:28,960 --> 02:11:30,010
That don't make sense.

1261
02:11:30,160 --> 02:11:30,450
It's.

1262
02:11:30,450 --> 02:11:31,283
A Sony thing.

1263
02:11:35,030 --> 02:11:38,450
Second formation of the evening when this

1264
02:11:39,970 --> 02:11:41,970
is going to be Hamilton.

1265
02:12:08,590 --> 02:12:11,340
Sonny, we just heard from
the stewards. God damn it.

1266
02:12:11,340 --> 02:12:13,940
Now we're debating whether
to tell you. Casper.

1267
02:12:13,940 --> 02:12:16,980
Says yes, but Kate says don't. She
says you're fast when you're angry.

1268
02:12:17,930 --> 02:12:18,980
Tell her job well done.

1269
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:21,113
And here's news.

1270
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:26,180
Stewards have made their decision that
lap 55 collision between Hazen Russell

1271
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:30,580
is ruled a racing incident investigation.

1272
02:12:36,010 --> 02:12:38,980
That was your line. Sunny
can finish your race.

1273
02:12:42,000 --> 02:12:46,060
Joshua still got two cars
in the mix. Then we've got.

1274
02:12:46,060 --> 02:12:49,340
A team. Once those red lights go out,

1275
02:12:49,370 --> 02:12:53,340
this will be an absolute
sprint to the finish position.

1276
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:57,300
Advantage to Mercedes and Ferrari,
our entire advantage to Apex.

1277
02:13:24,350 --> 02:13:27,880
Kill jp. To follow my lead,
Joshua says to follow him.

1278
02:13:28,990 --> 02:13:29,823
He's behind me.

1279
02:13:32,760 --> 02:13:34,450
Lost it with me.

1280
02:13:43,480 --> 02:13:44,313
He's giving you a

1281
02:14:14,430 --> 02:14:15,263
get it.

1282
02:14:31,630 --> 02:14:36,090
Racing. It's a beautiful
sight. But now their.

1283
02:14:38,690 --> 02:14:40,170
Hamilton. Yeah.

1284
02:15:19,710 --> 02:15:22,570
Why didn't they overtake? Lewis will
defend whichever car attacks first.

1285
02:15:22,750 --> 02:15:24,010
The boat can't work. Yes.

1286
02:15:24,010 --> 02:15:25,650
Someone has to sacrifice.

1287
02:16:08,480 --> 02:16:12,410
Come on guys. Talk to me West.

1288
02:16:12,670 --> 02:16:16,730
Can he finish one more lap? JP
Hamilton never backs down. Yes,

1289
02:16:17,350 --> 02:16:21,650
the race man. Yes, he's on track.
What you do fights your be one.

1290
02:16:21,950 --> 02:16:23,010
No more risks.

1291
02:16:46,780 --> 02:16:50,250
Sonny Bush be one. You be one. Apex.

1292
02:16:50,450 --> 02:16:54,970
GP has only won lap to go. The
question is do they have the car?

1293
02:16:56,110 --> 02:16:57,000
We have the driver.

1294
02:17:48,870 --> 02:17:50,530
What's up? He's.

1295
02:19:16,950 --> 02:19:19,210
It means another three
years for Ruben, right?

1296
02:19:21,080 --> 02:19:21,913
Yeah.

1297
02:19:22,840 --> 02:19:24,330
I guess we'll check back about that deal.

1298
02:19:27,440 --> 02:19:28,050
Presuming.

1299
02:19:28,050 --> 02:19:29,170
You are still on the board.

1300
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:39,833
Breathtaking.

1301
02:19:40,270 --> 02:19:44,770
Breath. Incredible. What this.

1302
02:19:49,000 --> 02:19:51,770
It's a for the ages. An absolute thrill.

1303
02:19:52,270 --> 02:19:56,370
And this man his been 30 years.

1304
02:20:06,630 --> 02:20:09,000
I'm going to win a million races.
You should at least that one.

1305
02:20:11,700 --> 02:20:12,533
We did it.

1306
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:27,250
If you somewhere nowhere to find thanks.

1307
02:22:29,580 --> 02:22:29,920
I'm happy.

1308
02:22:29,920 --> 02:22:31,880
Where I am. Delicious.

1309
02:22:34,950 --> 02:22:35,783
Yeah, baby.

1310
02:23:49,960 --> 02:23:51,610
Another right? I don't know about.

1311
02:23:53,500 --> 02:23:57,190
Somewhere that beats this.

1312
02:24:06,080 --> 02:24:08,590
I wanted to say see you down the road,

1313
02:24:09,170 --> 02:24:11,830
but in a way that was more poetic.

1314
02:24:14,640 --> 02:24:18,860
So can I see you down the road?

1315
02:24:25,200 --> 02:24:26,033
Yes.

1316
02:24:42,140 --> 02:24:46,470
Hang on to that. Okay.

1317
02:24:51,210 --> 02:24:52,070
And drive fast.

1318
02:25:02,570 --> 02:25:06,630
Now. Where do you think you'll
go? Don't worry about me.

1319
02:25:07,080 --> 02:25:07,913
Go celebrate.

1320
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:11,990
But you're off to where you know
a couple more dragons to slay.

1321
02:25:12,740 --> 02:25:13,630
It's your team now.

1322
02:25:16,730 --> 02:25:18,150
It was always my team.

1323
02:25:21,940 --> 02:25:25,420
I'll be watching. See you around. Sw.

1324
02:26:41,730 --> 02:26:42,563
Hello?

1325
02:26:49,000 --> 02:26:52,240
I told you're looking for
a driver. What's your name?

1326
02:26:53,770 --> 02:26:54,603
Sonny Hayes.

1327
02:26:59,580 --> 02:26:59,880
Have.

1328
02:26:59,880 --> 02:27:00,713
You ever driven?

1329
02:27:02,470 --> 02:27:06,920
Nope. We can't pay much.
Not about the money.

1330
02:27:12,050 --> 02:27:14,150
So what is it about I.
