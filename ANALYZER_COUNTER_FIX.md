# Resume Analyzer Counter Fix

## Issue
The "Analyses remaining this month" counter was not decreasing after analyzing a resume via PDF upload.

## Root Cause
The `fetchMonthlyUsageAnalyzer()` call was missing in the main PDF analysis success path. It was only called in the fallback PDF.js path.

## Fix Applied

### Frontend (`ResumeAnalyzer.tsx`)
Added `fetchMonthlyUsageAnalyzer()` call after successful Gemini AI PDF analysis:

```typescript
// Line ~559
setResult(analysis);
setUploadState('analyzed');
setHasAnalysisResults(true);
toast.success("Resume analyzed with AI!");

// âœ… NEW: Refresh monthly usage counter after successful analysis
fetchMonthlyUsageAnalyzer();
return;
```

### Backend (`server.js`)
1. **Removed duplicate increment** in form analysis endpoint
2. **Added better logging** for all analysis increment calls:
   - Form-based analysis: `ðŸ“Š About to increment analysis usage for user`
   - PDF Gemini analysis: `ðŸ“Š About to increment analysis usage (PDF Gemini) for user`
   - Scanned PDF fallback: `ðŸ“Š About to increment analysis usage (scanned PDF fallback) for user`

## Verification Steps

1. **Check Frontend**: After analyzing a resume, watch the counter change from "3" â†’ "2" â†’ "1" â†’ "0"
2. **Check Backend Logs**: Look for these messages:
   ```
   ðŸ“Š About to increment analysis usage (PDF Gemini) for user: [user-id]
   ðŸ“Š Incrementing usage for user [user-id], action: analysis, 2025-10
   ðŸ“Š Current usage before increment: { count: 0, ... }
   âœ… Usage incremented via RPC: null
   âœ… Analysis usage increment completed successfully (PDF Gemini)
   ```
3. **Check Database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM resume_usage 
   WHERE user_id = 'YOUR_USER_ID'::uuid 
     AND action = 'analysis'
     AND year = 2025 
     AND month = 10;
   ```
   Count should increase after each analysis.

## All Analysis Paths Now Covered

| Analysis Type | Increment Location | Frontend Refresh |
|--------------|-------------------|------------------|
| Form-based (Gemini) | âœ… Line ~927 | âœ… Line ~170 |
| PDF (Gemini AI) | âœ… Line ~1145 | âœ… Line ~559 (NEW) |
| PDF (Scanned fallback) | âœ… Line ~1016 | âœ… Line ~586 |

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload a text-based PDF â†’ Counter decreases
- [ ] Upload a scanned PDF â†’ Counter decreases
- [ ] Use form-based analysis â†’ Counter decreases
- [ ] Try 4th analysis after exhausting quota â†’ Shows error
- [ ] Backend logs show increment messages
- [ ] Database count increases correctly
