# Apply Button State Persistence Fix

## Issue
When a user applied for a lost item and added details, the "Apply" button became greyed out initially. However, when the page was refreshed, the button became ungreyed again, even though the user had already applied.

## Root Cause
The `applicant_user_id` field was not being saved to the database, causing the following chain of issues:

1. **Frontend**: `ApplicationSubmissionForm` wasn't receiving the user ID as a prop
2. **Frontend**: The user ID wasn't being sent in the API request
3. **Backend**: The user ID wasn't being extracted from the request body
4. **Database**: The `applicant_user_id` field remained `NULL` in the database

When the page refreshed, the `useEffect` in `LostAndFound.tsx` queried for applications:
```typescript
.eq('applicant_user_id', user.id)
```

Since all applications had `NULL` for `applicant_user_id`, the query returned empty results, making the button appear ungreyed.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Frontend Component Update (`ApplicationSubmissionForm.tsx`)

**Added `currentUserId` prop to interface:**
```typescript
interface ApplicationSubmissionFormProps {
  currentUserId: string;
  lostItemId: string;
  lostItemTitle: string;
  // ...other props
}
```

**Updated component to accept and use the prop:**
```typescript
export function ApplicationSubmissionForm({
  currentUserId,
  lostItemId,
  lostItemTitle,
  // ...
}: ApplicationSubmissionFormProps) {
```

**Sent user ID in API request:**
```typescript
const response = await fetch(`${API_URL}/api/submit-lost-item-application`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    applicantUserId: currentUserId, // ADDED THIS
    lostItemId,
    lostItemTitle,
    lostItemOwnerEmail,
    // ...other fields
  })
});
```

### 2. Backend Update (`backend/server.js`)

**Added `applicantUserId` to request body destructuring:**
```javascript
const {
  lostItemId,
  lostItemTitle,
  lostItemOwnerEmail,
  applicantUserId, // ADDED THIS
  applicantName,
  applicantEmail,
  // ...
} = req.body;
```

**Added logging for debugging:**
```javascript
console.log('Applicant User ID:', applicantUserId);
```

**Saved user ID to database:**
```javascript
const { data: applicationData, error: insertError } = await supabase
  .from('lost_found_applications')
  .insert({
    lost_item_id: lostItemId,
    applicant_user_id: applicantUserId || null, // ADDED THIS
    applicant_name: applicantName,
    // ...
  })
```

### 3. Parent Component Update (`LostAndFound.tsx`)

**Passed user ID as prop:**
```typescript
<ApplicationSubmissionForm
  currentUserId={user.id} // ADDED THIS
  lostItemId={showApplicationForm.item.id}
  lostItemTitle={showApplicationForm.item.title}
  // ...
/>
```

## How It Works Now

1. **User applies for lost item**: `LostAndFound.tsx` passes `user.id` to `ApplicationSubmissionForm`
2. **Form submission**: Frontend sends `applicantUserId` in the API request
3. **Backend processing**: Server extracts `applicantUserId` and inserts it into database
4. **Database record**: `applicant_user_id` is now a valid UUID instead of `NULL`
5. **Page refresh**: `useEffect` queries with `.eq('applicant_user_id', user.id)` and finds the application
6. **Button state**: Button remains greyed because `userAppliedItems[itemId]` is `true`

## Additional Benefits

This fix also enables:

- **Proper duplicate prevention**: The unique constraint `UNIQUE (lost_item_id, applicant_user_id)` now works correctly
- **User-specific queries**: Can now fetch all applications by a specific user
- **Data integrity**: Applications are properly linked to user accounts
- **Analytics**: Can track which users are most active in the application system

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] User applies for item → Button greys out
- [ ] Refresh page → Button stays greyed
- [ ] Check database → `applicant_user_id` contains UUID, not NULL
- [ ] Try applying again → Gets duplicate error (409 Conflict)
- [ ] Different user applies for same item → Allowed
- [ ] Same user applies for different item → Allowed

## Files Modified

1. `src/components/ApplicationSubmissionForm.tsx` - Added currentUserId prop and request body
2. `backend/server.js` - Added applicantUserId to destructuring and database insert
3. `src/pages/LostAndFound.tsx` - Passed user.id as currentUserId prop
