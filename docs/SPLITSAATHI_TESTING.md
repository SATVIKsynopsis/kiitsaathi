## Critical Bug Fix: "Paid by" Selector Empty

### Root Cause Analysis

**Issue:** When users tried to add an expense, the "Paid by" dropdown was empty, preventing expense creation.

**Root Causes Identified:**
1. **Validation Mismatch:** Group creation validation only checked for member names, not email_phone. This allowed groups to be created with members that had names but no contact info, which were then filtered out during insertion, resulting in groups with 0 members.
2. **Missing User Feedback:** No visual warning when viewing a group with no members.
3. **Dropdown Visibility:** SelectContent lacked proper styling (z-index, background) making it sometimes invisible.

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Frontend Validation (SplitSaathi.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Updated `createGroup()` validation to require BOTH name AND email_phone for each member
- ‚úÖ Added early validation with clear error messages
- ‚úÖ Added console logging for debugging member insertion

#### 2. UI Improvements (GroupDashboard.tsx)
- ‚úÖ Added visual warning card when group has 0 members
- ‚úÖ Disabled "Add Expense" button when no members exist
- ‚úÖ Improved SelectContent styling with proper z-index and background colors
- ‚úÖ Added member count display in dropdown footer
- ‚úÖ Enhanced logging for member fetch operations
- ‚úÖ Added "Add Members Now" button that takes user to Settings

#### 3. Database Queries
- ‚úÖ Verified RLS policies allow group creators to see and manage members
- ‚úÖ Confirmed `is_group_creator()` and `is_group_member()` functions work correctly
- ‚úÖ Identified 3 groups in database with 0 members (legacy data)
