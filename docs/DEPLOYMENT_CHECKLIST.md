## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**
   - Migration is ready in supabase/migrations/
   - Execute via Supabase Dashboard or CLI
   - Verify all tables and functions created

2. **Deploy Edge Functions**
   - Functions auto-deploy with Lovable
   - Verify in Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions
   - Test each function endpoint

3. **Update Environment Variables**
   - ALLOWED_EMAIL_DOMAIN=kiit.ac.in (already set in edge function)

4. **Test Authentication Flow** (See SECURITY_AUTH_TESTING.md)
   - Test non-KIIT signup rejection
   - Test KIIT signup + verification
   - Test OAuth with KIIT/non-KIIT emails
   - Test unverified user blocked from actions

## 📊 Post-Deployment Monitoring

### First 24 Hours
- [ ] Check auth_violations table every 2 hours
- [ ] Monitor email_logs for delivery issues
- [ ] Review auth_events for anomalies
- [ ] Test 5+ signup flows

### Metrics to Watch
- Domain rejection rate (should be > 0 if attacks occur)
- Email bounce rate (should be < 5%)
- Verification success rate (should be > 90%)

## 🔐 Security Validation

All authentication paths are now secured:
✅ Email/Password signup - Domain validated server-side
✅ Google OAuth - Domain validated in callback
✅ Email verification - Required for all protected actions
✅ RLS policies - Enforce is_verified_kiit_user check
✅ Logging - All auth events tracked
✅ Monitoring - Alerts for suspicious activity

**Status**: PRODUCTION-READY ✅
